Execute a GraphQL query to **search and replace a string in all posts in your site**, also using regular expressions to match string patterns.

You will be able to replace the domain after a site migration, update links to pages after changing their slug, modify all image URLs after introducing a CDN, remove CSS styles hardcoded in HTML code, add missing links, and much more.
