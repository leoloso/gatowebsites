Connect to the **Google Translate API** within the GraphQL query, and **translate content to over 130 languages**, with support for the Gutenberg editor, the Classic editor, and page builders.

The GraphQL query sends all strings to translate in a single request to Google Translate, making the translation as accurate as possible. Then keep editing the post within the WordPress editor.
