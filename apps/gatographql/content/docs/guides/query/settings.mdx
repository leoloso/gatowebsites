These are examples of queries to fetch settings from the `wp_options` table.

## Fetching settings

Fetch the site's URL, name and description, all of them stored as a single value:

query {
  siteURL: optionValue(name: "home")
  siteName: optionValue(name: "blogname")
  siteDescription: optionValue(name: "blogdescription")
}
```

Fetch the site's sticky posts, which is stored as an array:

```graphql
query {
  stickyPosts: optionValues(name: "sticky_posts")
}
```

Fetch some custom option, stored as an object:

```graphql
query {
  themeMods: optionObjectValue(name: "theme_mods_twentytwentyone")
}
```
