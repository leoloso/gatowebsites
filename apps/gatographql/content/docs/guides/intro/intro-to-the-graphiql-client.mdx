Gato GraphQL provides the GraphiQL client to interact with the GraphQL service. Access it by clicking on "GraphiQL" on the plugin's menu:

GraphiQL enables to composer GraphQL queries, execute them, and visualize their response:

## GraphiQL client guide

This is how to use the GraphiQL client to compose and execute a GraphQL query.

We compose the GraphQL query on the panel on the left-side:

![GraphiQL client](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/graphiql-compose-query.png "GraphiQL client")

GraphiQL has a syntax highlighter for the [GraphQL syntax](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/). As we start composing the query, we can appreciate how the operation name, the opening and closing brackets, fields, arguments, directives and comments all have a distinct color, helping us to make sense of the query:

When first loading, GraphiQL will retrieve the GraphQL schema's metadata, via [introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/). Thanks to the schema metadata, at every moment while composing the query, GraphiQL will suggest autocomplete options:

![Autocomplete suggestions](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/graphiql-autocomplete.png "Autocomplete suggestions")

We can also browse the schema metadata via the Documentation Explorer. To open it, we must click on the "Docs" button:

![Docs button](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/graphiql-docs-btn.png "Docs button")

The Documentation Explorer will appear on the right-hand side:

![Documentation Explorer](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/graphiql-docs.png "Documentation Explorer")

By clicking on the GraphQL type's name, the Documentation Explorer will display its information:

- its description
- what interfaces it implements
- the list of all its fields, including:
  - what arguments they receive
  - their return type (on which we can also click)
  - their description

![Displaying the type's info](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/graphiql-docs-type-info.png "Displaying the type's info")

At any moment, we can also search for, and retrieve info for, any element from the schema:

![Searching](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/graphiql-docs-search.png "Searching")

Hovering on any element from the query will display its information, and `ctrl` (or `cmd`) + clicking on it will display it in the Documentation Explorer:

![Clicking on schema elements](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/graphiql-docs-ctrlclick.png "Clicking on schema elements")

Clicking on the "Query variables" panel at the bottom, we can compose variables to pass to the query, as a JSON map of `variable` => `value`:

![Completing query variables](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/graphiql-queryvariables.png "Completing query variables")

To execute the GraphQL query, we press on the "Run" button, or press `ctrl` (or `cmd`) + `enter`:

![Executing the GraphQL query](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/graphiql-docs-run-btn.png "Executing the GraphQL query")

The GraphQL response will be displayed on the central panel:

![GraphQL query response](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/graphiql-response.png "GraphQL query response")

On the top panel, there are different add-ons for GraphiQL:

![GraphiQL add-ons](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/graphiql-addons.png "GraphiQL add-ons")

Clicking on each add-on button, will perform a certain action:

- "Prettify" formats the GraphQL query
- "History" displays the list of most-recent previous queries, and clicking on any of them will input it into the query editor
- "Explorer" opens the GraphiQL Explorer panel

The GraphiQL Explorer is a great add-on. It displays the list of all the fields, and clicking on them adds them to the query in the editor, enabling to compose the GraphQL query in a visual manner:
