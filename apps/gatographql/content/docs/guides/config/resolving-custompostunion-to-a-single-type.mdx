If there is only one type added to `CustomPostUnion` (eg: only `Post`), we can then have the fields that resolve to `CustomPostUnion` be resolved to that unique type instead.

For that, head over to the Settings page for `Schema Custom Posts`, and click on option `"Use single type instead of union type?"`:

For instance, if `Post` is the only type, field `customPosts` from type `Root` resolves to it directly:

![`customPosts` field resolves to `Post` type](/assets/guides/upstream/interactive-schema-root.png "`customPosts` field resolves to `Post` type")
