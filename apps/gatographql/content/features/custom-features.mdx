Multiple features suggested for the GraphQL spec have already been implemented on Gato GraphQL, so we don't need to wait.

## Schema namespacing

If plugins WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads both implemented a `Product` type for the GraphQL API, then we could not install both plugins at the same time, since their types would conflict.

**Schema namespacing** enables to avoid conflicts in the schema, by having all type names namespaced. Hence, type `Product` would become `Woo_Product` and `EDD_Product` respectively, and these types could be added to the same schema.

This images shows a namespaced schema, in which types `Event` and `Location` were added the prefix `EM_` to avoid name collision:

## Global fields

Global fields are fields that are accessible under every single type in the GraphQL schema (while being defined only once).

The GraphQL schema exposes types, such as `Post`, `User` and `Comment`, and the fields available for every type, such as `Post.title`, `User.name` and `Comment.responses`. These fields deal with "data", as they retrieve some specific piece of data from an entity.

Gato GraphQL, in addition, also offers a different kind of fields: those providing "functionality" instead of data.

Some example global fields are:

- `_not`
- `_if`
- `_equals`
- `_isEmpty`
- `_echo`
- `_sprintf`
- `_arrayItem`
- `_arrayAddItem`
- `_arrayUnique`
- many more

Functionality fields are useful for obtaining data that is stored outside of WordPress, and for manipulating the data once it has been retrieved, allowing us to transform a field value in whatever way it is required, and granting us powerful data import/export capabilities.

Functionality fields belong not to a specific type, such as `Post` or `User`, but to all the types in the schema. That's why these are handled in a distinctive way in Gato GraphQL, under the name of "global fields".

## Field to input

Obtain the value of a field, manipulate it, and input it into another field, all within the same query.

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    excerpt

    # Referencing previous field with name "excerpt"
    isEmptyExcerpt: _isEmpty(value: $__excerpt)

    # Referencing previous field with alias "isEmptyExcerpt"
    isNotEmptyExcerpt: _not(value: $__isEmptyExcerpt)
  }
}
```

## Composable directives

Oftentimes, a directive cannot be applied on a field, because it has an input which is different than the field's output. For instance, directive `@strUpperCase` receives a string as input, so it can't be applied on field `User.capabilities`, which returns an array of strings.

With **composable directives**, a directive can augment another directive to modify its behavior or fill a gap. This removes the need to duplicate fields or directives just to change their input or return types, avoiding bloat.

In this query, directive `@underEachArrayItem` iterates over an array of strings, and applies its nested directive `@strUpperCase` on each of them, fixing the type mismatch:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    capabilities
      @underEachArrayItem
        @strUpperCase
  }
}
```

## Mulfi-field directives

Have directives applied to multiple fields (instead of only one), for performance and extended use cases.

When enabled, an argument `affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos` is added to all directives, where the relative positions of additional fields to apply the directive to can be specified.

For instance, in the following query, directive `@strTranslate` is applied only to field `content`:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    excerpt
    content @strTranslate
  }
}
```

Field `excerpt` can also be applied directive `@strTranslate`, by adding the directive argument `affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos` with value `[1]` (as `1` is the relative position of field `excerpt` from directive `@strTranslate`):

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    excerpt
    content
      @strTranslate(
        affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos: [1]
      )
  }
}
```

## Field and directive-based versioning

Version fields and directives independently from the schema.

Instead of evolving the whole schema (which requires to modify the name of the modified field or directive), we can:

- Keep different implementations under the same field or directive name
- Expose the legacy implementation under a tag, using semantic versioning
- Access a specific version through field/directive argument `versionConstraint`

## Proactive feedback

Use the top-level entry `extensions` to send data concerning deprecations and warnings in the response to the query.

- **Deprecations:** Deprecations are returned in the same query involving deprecated fields, and not only when doing introspection.
- **Warnings:** Warning are issues which can be considered non-blocking, i.e. they enhance the query but do not break it.

For instance, the following query exports two fields using the same dynamic variable name `"prop"`, which generates a warning:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    excerpt @export(as: "prop")
    content @export(as: "prop")
  }
}
```

The response will include section `warnings` (under `extensions`) with a corresponding message:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "warnings": [
      {
        "message": "Dynamic variable with name 'props' had already been set, had its value overridden",
        "locations": [
          {
            "line": 4,
            "column": 25
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "data": {
    "posts": {
      "excerpt": "Hello world!",
      "Content": "<p>Hello world!</p>"
    }
  }
}
```
