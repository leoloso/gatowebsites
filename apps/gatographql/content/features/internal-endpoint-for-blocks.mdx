An internal GraphQL endpoint, called `blockEditor`, is accessible within the wp-admin only, to allow developers to fetch data for their Gutenberg blocks.

This endpoint has a pre-defined configuration (i.e. it does not have the user preferences from the plugin applied to it), so its behavior is consistent.

It is accessible under URL:

```apacheconf
https://yoursite.com/wp-admin/edit.php?page=gatographql&action=execute_query&endpoint_group=blockEditor
```

The global JS variable `GATOGRAPHQL_BLOCK_EDITOR_ADMIN_ENDPOINT` prints the URL for the `blockEditor` endpoint in the wp-admin editor, for all users who can access the GraphQL schema. This makes it easier to point to this endpoint within the block's JavaScript code.
