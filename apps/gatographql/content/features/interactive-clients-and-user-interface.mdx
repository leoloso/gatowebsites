Gato GraphQL provides a multitude of interactive clients, and a user interface based on the WordPress editor, so that anybody can operate it, whether a developer or not.

## User-friendly interface

Gato GraphQL provides a multitude of graphical clients (based on the WordPress editor) to configure the GraphQL schema, deprecate fields, define access control and cache control, and others:

/>

These clients make it very easy to interact with Gato GraphQL, directly within the wp-admin (and without the need of any PHP code), reducing friction and removing barriers so that anyone (developers and non-developers alike) can use it.

## GraphiQL client

Execute the query against the GraphQL server using the [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) client:

The [GraphiQL Explorer](https://github.com/OneGraph/graphiql-explorer) is also provided, allowing us to compose the GraphQL query in a visual manner, by clicking on fields:

## Voyager client

Visualize the GraphQL schema using the [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager) client:

  caption="GraphQL Voyager client"
/>

This tool enables to interact with the schema, as to understand how every entity in the application's data model relate to each other.
