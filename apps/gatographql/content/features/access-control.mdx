{/* ðŸ“£ **Note:** This feature is unlocked by the [Access Control](/extensions/access-control) extension. */}

The GraphQL endpoint, which can return any piece of data accessible through the schema, could potentially allow malicious actors to retrieve private information. Hence, we must implement security measures to protect the data.

## Access Control

With **access control lists**, we can define who can access each operation, field and directive in the schema:

- Disable access to everyone
- Grant access if the user is logged-in, or logged-out
- Grant access if the user has some role
- Grant access if the user has some capability
- Grant access if the visitor comes from some IP or IP range

## Public/Private Schema

What should happen when a user without access to some field or directive in the schema, attempts to access it?

With the **public/private API mode** we can control the desired behavior:

In the **public API**, the fields in the schema are exposed, and when the permission is not satisfied, the user gets an error message with a description of why the permission was rejected.

In the **private API**, the schema is customized to every user, containing only the fields available to him or her, and so when attempting to access a forbidden field, the error message says that the field doesn't exist.
