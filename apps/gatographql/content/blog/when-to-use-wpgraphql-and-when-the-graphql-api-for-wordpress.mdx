Update 01/05/2024: <strong>Check-out the [Gato GraphQL vs WPGraphQL](/comparisons/gatographql-vs-wpgraphql) comparison.</strong>

</Banner>

A few days ago, I published an article on Smashing Magazine: [Making GraphQL Work In WordPress](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/making-graphql-work-in-wordpress/).

This article answers, from my own point of view (but objectively, I believe), the following questions:

‚ùì When should we use WPGraphQL, and when Gato GraphQL?<br/>
‚ùì Is there some advantage of one over the other, or some particular task that is easier to accomplish with one of them?

My conclusion (among a few others) is the following:

ü§úüèΩ When building a static site, use WPGraphQL<br/>
ü§úüèΩ When exposing a live GraphQL API, use Gato GraphQL

The differences exposed in this article are from a bird-eye's view, broadly exposing a guide to decide when to use each plugin.

Sounds interesting? Please [check it out](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/making-graphql-work-in-wordpress/).

If you'd also like to understand the technical differences between the two plugins, some time ago I wrote another blog post: [ü•ä Gato GraphQL vs WPGraphQL: the fight!](/blog/graphql-api-vs-wpgraphql-the-fight).

Enjoy!
