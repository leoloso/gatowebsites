Yesterday I talked about GraphQL on WordPress, for WordCamp India 2021. I explored these topics:

👉🏽 What is GraphQL?<br/>
👉🏽 How is it different from REST?<br/>
👉🏽 How do we use it with WordPress?

Alongside, I did a demo of the [Gato GraphQL](/) plugin. It's all me showing how to use the plugin in the wp-admin, for some 30 min.

Here is the video:

<div className="aspect-video">
  <iframe
    className="w-full h-full"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LnyNyT2RwwI"
    width="768"
    height="432"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  >
  </iframe>
</div>

The following features were covered:

✅ The GraphiQL and Voyager clients<br/>
✅ Persisted queries<br/>
✅ Passing parameters by URL to the persisted query<br/>
✅ HTTP caching<br/>
✅ Access control<br/>
✅ Making the API public and private

We also had a Q&A session, which lasted 15 min. Here is the video:

<div className="aspect-video">
  <iframe
    className="w-full h-full"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Z6PgfreTxg"
    width="768"
    height="432"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  >
  </iframe>
</div>

The Q&A include the following questions, and at what time they appear:

❓ Will the hosting provider support GraphQL, or do we need to manage it on our own? _(1:25)_<br/>
❓ How extensible is it, compared to the WP REST API? _(1:55)_<br/>
❓ Is multilingual search supported in GraphQL? (answer is not clear, connection problems) _(2:39)_<br/>
❓ How do we secure the GraphQL API? _(3:48)_<br/>
❓ Why is Gato GraphQL plugin not officially available in the WordPress plugin repository? _(6:48)_<br/>
❓ What is the limit for GraphQL? _(8:08)_<br/>
❓ If somebody wants to dive into GraphQL, what's your advice for them? _(10:21)_<br/>
❓ What can we expect from you should you present a new talk about GraphQL in another WordCamp? _(12:08)_

As I mentioned at the end of the Q&A, if you like what you see, and you'd like to learn more, or get your hands dirty using it and need help, [send me an email](/contact) or [DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/losoviz). I'm generally available, and always thrilled to work on the combination of WordPress and GraphQL 🙏

I hope you've enjoyed the demo 😀
