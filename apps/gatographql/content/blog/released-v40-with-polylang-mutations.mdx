Gato GraphQL `v4.0` has been released. Check out the [release notes in GitHub](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/releases/tag/4.0.0) for the complete list of changes.

**This version fixes a serious bug that made the plugin not work on PHP 8.2**.

Concerning new features, the most important one belongs to Gato GraphQL PRO.

## [PRO] Added Polylang Mutations

The new PRO module **Polylang Mutations** provides mutations for the integration with the [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) plugin.

The GraphQL schema is provided with mutations to:

- Establish the language for custom posts, tags and categories, and
- Define associations among them (i.e. indicate that a set of custom posts, tags or categories is a translation for each other).

| Mutation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `polylangSetCustomPostLanguage` | Set the language of the custom post. |
| `polylangSetTaxonomyTermLanguage` | Set the language of the taxonomy term. |
| `polylangSaveCustomPostTranslationAssociation` | Set the translation association for the custom post. |
| `polylangSaveTaxonomyTermTranslationAssociation` | Set the translation association for the taxonomy term. |

For instance, the following query defines the language for 3 posts (to English, Spanish and French), and then defines that these 3 posts are a translation of each other:

```graphql
mutation {
  post1: polylangSetCustomPostLanguage(input: {id: 1, languageBy: { code: "en" }}) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
  }
  post2: polylangSetCustomPostLanguage(input: {id: 2, languageBy: { code: "es" }}) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
  }
  post3: polylangSetCustomPostLanguage(input: {id: 3, languageBy: { code: "fr" }}) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
  }
  polylangSaveCustomPostTranslationAssociation(input: {
    ids: [1, 2, 3]
  }) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
  }
}
```
