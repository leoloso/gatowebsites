Gato GraphQL `v3.0` has been released, containing new features and a couple of breaking changes. Check out the [release notes in GitHub](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/releases/tag/3.0.0) for the complete list of changes.

Below are the most important updates.

## Added compatibility with WordPress 6.6

Gato GraphQL `3.0` has recompiled all its blocks, to make them compatible with WordPress 6.6. (For all previous versions, blocks will throw a JS error.)

## Added bulk mutation fields (for all mutations in the schema)

Gato GraphQL `3.0` adds "bulk" mutation fields for all mutations in the schema, allowing us to mutate multiple resources.

For instance, mutation `createPosts` (single-resource mutation is `createPost`) will create multiple posts:

```graphql
mutation CreatePosts {
  createPosts(inputs: [
    {
      title: "First post"
      contentAs: {
        html: "This is the content for the first post"
      }
    },
    {
      title: "Second post"
      contentAs: {
        html: "Here is another content, for another post"
      }
      excerpt: "The cup is within reach"
    },
    {
      title: "Third post"
      contentAs: {
        html: "This is yet another piece of content"
      },
      authorBy: {
        id: 1
      },
      status: draft
    }
  ]) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
    post {
      id
      title
      content
      excerpt
      author {
        name
      }
      status
    }
  }
}
```

Bulk mutations unlock possibilities for managing our WordPress site. For instance, the following GraphQL query uses `createPosts` (and Multiple Query Execution, provided by Gato GraphQL PRO) to duplicate posts:

```graphql
query ExportPostData
{
  postsToDuplicate: posts {
    rawTitle
    rawContent
    rawExcerpt
    postInput: _echo(value: {
      title: $__rawTitle
      contentAs: {
        html: $__rawContent
      },
      excerpt: $__rawExcerpt
    })
      @export(as: "postInputs", type: LIST)
      @remove
  }
}

mutation CreatePosts
  @depends(on: "ExportPostData")
{
  createPosts(inputs: $postInputs) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
    post {
      id
      title
      content
      excerpt
    }
  }
}
```

The list of added bulk mutation fields is the following:

- `Root.addCommentToCustomPosts`
- `Root.createCustomPosts`
- `Root.createMediaItems`
- `Root.createPages`
- `Root.createPosts`
- `Root.removeFeaturedImageFromCustomPosts`
- `Root.replyComments`
- `Root.setCategoriesOnPosts`
- `Root.setFeaturedImageOnCustomPosts`
- `Root.setTagsOnPosts`
- `Root.updateCustomPosts`
- `Root.updatePages`
- `Root.updatePosts`
- `Comment.replyWithComments`
- `CustomPost.addComments`

## Breaking change: Require at least WordPress v6.0

In order to support WordPress `v6.6`, blocks in the plugin had to be re-compiled targetting WordPress `v6.0`+.

Hence, starting from `v3.0`, Gato GraphQL requires at least WordPress `v6.0`.

## Breaking change: Schema configuration block "Payload Types for Mutations" may need be reconfigured

Schema configuration block "Payload Types for Mutations" has been added a new option value: "Do not use payload types for mutations (i.e. return the mutated entity)". For this reason, its inner data structure has changed.

If you have created a schema configuration with option "Do not use payload types for mutations (i.e. return the mutated entity)" selected, after upgrading to `v3.0` this selection value will be lost. You need to edit the schema configuration, select this option again, and save.
