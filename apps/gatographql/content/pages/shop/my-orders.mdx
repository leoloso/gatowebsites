## Upgrading Gato GraphQL extensions

While your purchased product's license is active, the download file, available in LemonSqueezy's <a href="https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders" target="_blank">My orders</a> page, will be the most up-to-date one.

Whenever the Gato GraphQL plugin releases a new version, its extensions may also release a new, corresponding upgrade, with the same version number.

Check if there is such an update and, if so, download it and install it on your WordPress site.
