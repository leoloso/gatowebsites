The licenses for your purchased Gato GraphQL products can be managed via the [Customer Portal](/shop/customer-portal).

## Installing the Gato GraphQL extension in WordPress

_(Make sure that you have the Gato GraphQL plugin installed and active.)_

Download the Gato GraphQL extension plugin file from the link in the email.

Install it in your WordPress site (under `Plugins > Add new > Upload`), and activate it.

Upon activation, an admin notice will request to provide the license key:

  alt="Admin notice requesting to provide the license key"
  caption="Admin notice requesting to provide the license key"
/>

Click on the link to go to the Settings page. Then copy/paste the license key, and click on `Activate Licenses (or Deactivate/Validate)`.

## Upgrading the Gato GraphQL extension (when a new version is released)

While your purchased product's license is active, the download file (available via [My Orders](/shop/my-orders)) will be the most up-to-date one.

Whenever the Gato GraphQL plugin releases a new version, its extensions may also release a new, corresponding upgrade, with the same version number.

Check if there is such an update and, if so, download it and install it on your WordPress site.
