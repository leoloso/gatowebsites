If you just need to build a headless WordPress site and deploy it as static, and you're currently using <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com" rel="nofollow">WPGraphQL</a>, switching to Gato GraphQL will not make any difference.

Otherwise, switching to Gato GraphQL provides many advantages. The following are benefits provided by Gato GraphQL + Gato GraphQL PRO, that WPGraphQL does not.

## Ease of development

The "n+1" query problem just doesn't happen, by design.

## Security

When using [persisted queries](/features/persisted-queries) to expose predefined data, you can completely disable the GraphQL single endpoint, so that it is not accessible even to authenticated users.

## Access control

You can validate that only logged-in users, or users with a certain role or capability, or visitors from a certain IP range, [can access data](/features/access-control), on a field-by-field basis (PRO).

/>

## Cache control

When caching the GraphQL response using standard [HTTP caching](/features/http-caching), the `max-age` header is calculated automatically, from all the fields present in the GraphQL query (PRO).

## Endpoint customization and management

You can provide multiple [custom endpoints](/features/custom-endpoints), each of them customized to a specific customer or application, [protecting them via a password](/features/public-private-and-password-protected-endpoints).

And you can [add custom categories](/features/endpoint-management) to them, and [give them a hierarchy](/features/api-hierarchy) (such as `/graphql/customers/some-customer` and `/graphql/customers/another-customer`).

  src="/assets/guides/upstream/password-protected-custom-endpoint.png"
  width="1024"
  height="940"
  alt="Password-protected Custom Endpoint"
  caption="Password-protected Custom Endpoint"
/>

## Bulk updates

You can execute updates in bulk. For instance, you can delete all comments on the site, or assign a tag or category to all your posts.

And you can search and replace a string on hundreds of posts, for instance to [replace an old with the new domain](/library/replace-the-old-domain-with-a-new-domain-in-all-posts), and even [using a regex](/library/regex-search-and-replace-multiple-strings-in-all-posts) (PRO).

## Custom GraphQL features

You will have access to novel GraphQL features, proposed for the spec but not yet released, including [nested mutations](/features/nested-mutations), [schema namespacing](/features/schema-namespacing) and the ['oneOf' Input Object](/features/oneof-input-object).

</div>

## Multiple Query Execution

WPGraphQL allows to execute <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/docs/wpgraphql-vs-wp-rest-api#batch-queries" rel="nofollow">queries in batch</a>, where multiple GraphQL queries are resolved within a single HTTP request.

Gato GraphQL provides [Multiple Query Execution](/features/multiple-query-execution), where a single GraphQL document can execute multiple operations.

**Multiple Query Execution** is an improvement over **query batching**, as the operations can share state with one another via the `@export` directive.

For instance, to [duplicate a post](/library/duplicate-post), we have a `query` operation fetch the post data, and pass this data to a `mutation` operation that creates a new post with it:

```graphql
query GetPostAndExportData($postId: ID!)
{
  post(by: { id: $postId }, status: any) {
    author {
      id @export(as: "authorID")
    }
    categories {
      id @export(as: "categoryIDs", type: LIST)
    }
    rawContent @export(as: "rawContent")
    rawExcerpt @export(as: "excerpt")
    featuredImage {
      id @export(as: "featuredImageID")
    }
    tags {
      id @export(as: "tagIDs", type: LIST)
    }
    rawTitle @export(as: "title")
  }
}
 
mutation DuplicatePost
  @depends(on: "GetPostAndExportData")
{
  createPost(input: {
    status: draft,
    authorBy: {
      id: $authorID
    },
    categoriesBy: {
      ids: $categoryIDs
    },
    contentAs: {
      html: $rawContent
    },
    excerpt: $excerpt
    featuredImageBy: {
      id: $featuredImageID
    },
    tagsBy: {
      ids: $tagIDs
    },
    title: $title
  }) {
    postID
  }
}
```

## Composability

You will have the ability to [compose fields](/features/field-to-input), where the value of a field can be provided as input to another field in the same query, allowing a foundational set of field resolvers to cover an unlimited number of use cases (PRO).

For instance, instead of creating field `Post.hasExcerpt`, we can apply field `_notEmpty` on `Post.excerpt` to produce the same value:

```graphql
query {
  post(by: { id: 1 }) {
    excerpt 
    hasExcerpt: _notEmpty(value: $__excerpt)
  }
}
```

Similarly, you can [compose directives](/features/composable-directives), so that a directive can be applied on an inner property from the field's value.

For instance, the following query translates the post's category names to another language:

```graphql
query {
  post(by: { id: 1 }) {
    title
    categoryNames
    frenchCategoryNames: categoryNames
      @underEachArrayItem
        @strTranslate(
          from: "en",
          to: "fr"
        )
  }
}
```

## GraphQL server availability

You can expose private endpoints to power your Gutenberg blocks. And you can [access a private GraphQL server](/extensions/internal-graphql-server), to fetch data for your application using PHP code, without exposing any public-facing endpoint (PRO).

## Versatility on mutating data

You can use GraphQL to retrieve, modify and finally store again the content in your site, all within a single GraphQL document (PRO).

For instance, you can fetch all the Gutenberg blocks in a post, extract their properties, [translate those strings via Google Translate API](/library/translate-post-gutenberg), insert those strings back into the block, and store the post again.

    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  >
  </iframe>
</div>

## Content sync and distribution

You can use GraphQL to [import posts from another WordPress site](/library/import-post-from-wp-site), [from an RSS feed](/library/import-post-from-wp-rss-feed), [from a CSV](/library/import-posts-from-csv), or from any REST or GraphQL API (PRO).

You can [export content to another WordPress site](/library/export-post-to-wp-site), and store it as JSON and CSV (PRO).

## Web service interaction

You can invoke the API of any external service via an [HTTP client](/features/http-client) (PRO). For instance, you can [subscribe your WordPress users to your Mailchimp email list](/library/subscribe-email-on-mailchimp-list).

And you can [receive and process incoming data from any service](/extensions/http-request-via-schema) via a dedicated webhook (PRO). For instance, you can [capture the newsletter emails registered in an InstaWP sandbox site](/library/register-a-newsletter-subscriber-from-instawp-to-mailchimp) and send them automatically to Mailchimp.

## Automation

You can use GraphQL to [automate tasks and content workflows](/features/automation) (PRO).

For instance, when a new post is created (event via hook `draft_post`) you can execute a persisted query that checks if the post does not have a thumbnail and, in that case, [generates an image by calling the Stable Diffusion API](/library/generate-an-optimized-post-featured-image-using-stable-diffusion-and-tinypng), compresses it via TinyPng, and finally inserts the image as the post's featured image.

## Ease of use

All of these additional uses cases can be achieved directly within the wp-admin, providing the GraphQL query via a user interface, without having to deploy any PHP code.
