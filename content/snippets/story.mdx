**Gato GraphQL** is the creation of [Leonardo Losoviz](https://leoloso.com), a developer who started coding for WordPress in 2012, and using GraphQL since 2019.

Leo has been working on making WordPress the single source of truth for all our content, as expressed in his article [“Create Once, Publish Everywhere” with WordPress](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/10/create-once-publish-everywhere-wordpress/), from 2019.

With the **advent of GraphQL and the WordPress block editor** (aka Gutenberg) around that same time, Leo understood that these could provide the foundation to achieve the sought-after goal:

- Use the block editor to store structured data in WordPress
- Use GraphQL to retrieve that data, for any client and application

And hence, work on what would end-up being Gato GraphQL commenced.

During this process, there was the realization that **GraphQL is more powerful than commonly known**, and that it could be used for more use cases than just retrieving data for a client.

Leo then designed Gato GraphQL to retrieve any piece of data in WordPress, transform the data in any desired way, and store the data again to the DB, or execute some operation with it.

This was a formidable proposition, and it took 5 years of development to come to completion: In January 2024, [Gato GraphQL was released in the WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gatographql/).

Leo operates Gato GraphQL from the beautiful city of Kuala Lumpur, in Malaysia.
