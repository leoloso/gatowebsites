Let's say your website is a WordPress multisite, where every site is a translation to a different language, and you employ 3rd-party translators to translate the content. At the same time, you'd like to avoid giving access to your WordPress site's backend to external workers.

You can use **InstaWP** together with **Gato GraphQL** to provide for this use case.

This video demonstrates the translation workflow, using websites hosted in InstaWP:

<div className="aspect-video lg:-ml-32 lg:-mr-32">
  <iframe
    className="w-full h-full"
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/887586551"
    width="640"
    height="360"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  >
  </iframe>
</div>

The workflow involves three websites:

- The first site (`content-staging.instawp.xyz`) is the origin WordPress site, containing the source of content (in English)
- The second site (`translation-es.instawp.xyz`) is a temporary InstaWP site, created to give access to the translator
- The third site (`content-es.instawp.xyz`) is the translated site (in Spanish)

The content is taken from the origin site and automatically translated using **Google Translate**, then synchronized to the second site.

Create a site in InstaWP for your translator (or maybe for all the different translators, or for every language, or other). This may be a temporary site that is created just for this post, or a reserved site that you can keep using for future posts too.

In your staging site, write your blog post either using the block-based WordPress editor, or the classic editor (they are both supported).

When it's finished, use Gato GraphQL to translate the content to the desired language via Google Translate. If using the block editor, the translation will already be stored within each block (property by property), so you don't need to do any copy/pasting of strings and put them back on the post.

At this point, the staging site will contain the translated post, as a duplicate from the original.

Export this post to the translator's dedicated site on InstaWP, using Gato GraphQL (as in the video) or InstaWP Connect.

Then ask the translator to fix the translation, directly within the WordPress editor (or the classic editor), and save the post. You can expect Google Translate's translation to be around 90% accurate, so there's only 10% of work left to do.

When finished, import the final translated post to your production site for that language.

Voil√†! You have used independent environments to produce your content, translate it, and deploy it.
