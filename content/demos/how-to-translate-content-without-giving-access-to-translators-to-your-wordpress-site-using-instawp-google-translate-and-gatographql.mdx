Let's say your website is a WordPress multisite, where every site is a translation to a different language, and you employ 3rd-party translators to translate the content.

At the same time, you'd like to avoid giving access to your WordPress site's backend to external workers.

You can use **InstaWP** together with **Gato GraphQL**, plus the integration with **Google Translate**, to provide for this use case.

This video demonstrates the translation workflow:

<div className="aspect-video lg:-ml-32 lg:-mr-32">
  <iframe
    className="w-full h-full"
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/887586551"
    width="640"
    height="360"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  >
  </iframe>
</div>

The workflow involves three websites:

- The **origin site** (`content-staging.instawp.xyz`), containing the source of content in English
- The **provisional site** (`translation-es.instawp.xyz`), created on InstaWP, for the translator to fix the translation
- The **translated site** (`content-es.instawp.xyz`), containing the content in Spanish

Publish the blog post in your origin WordPress site, and translate it to the desired language using Gato GraphQL + Google Translate, as explained in demo [How to translate posts including blocks with the Google Translate API](/demos/how-to-translate-posts-including-blocks-with-the-google-translate-api).

The **origin site** will now contain the Google-Translated post as a duplicate from the original, with `draft` status. We need now to move it to the **provisional site**.

[Create a persisted query](/guides/use/creating-a-persisted-query) containing the following GraphQL query, and give it title **Export post to another WordPress site**:

```graphql
query ExportDownstreamGraphQLQuery
{
  query: _echo(value: """

mutation LoginUserAndUpdatePost(
  $username: String!
  $userPassword: String!
  $postSlug: String!
  $postTitle: String!
  $postContent: String!
) {
  loginUser(by: {
    credentials: {
      usernameOrEmail: $username,
      password: $userPassword
    }
  }) {
    userID
  }

  createPost(input: {
    title: $postTitle,
    slug: $postSlug,
    contentAs: { html: $postContent },
    status: draft
  })
  {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
    post {
      title
      slug
      content
      status
    }
  }
}

    """
  )
    @export(as: "query")
    @remove
}

query ExportPostToWPSite(
  $downstreamServerGraphQLEndpointURL: String!
  $username: String!
  $userPassword: String!
  $postSlug: String!
)
  @depends(on: "ExportDownstreamGraphQLQuery")
{
  _sendGraphQLHTTPRequest(
    input: {
      endpoint: $downstreamServerGraphQLEndpointURL,
      query: $query,
      variables: [
        {
          name: "username",
          value: $username
        },
        {
          name: "userPassword",
          value: $userPassword
        },
        {
          name: "postSlug",
          value: $postSlug
        },
        {
          name: "postTitle",
          value: $postTitle
        },
        {
          name: "postContent",
          value: $postContent
        }
      ]
    }
  )
}
```

This persisted query will export the post from the **origin site** to the **provisional site**. Execute it, providing the JSON dictionary with the needed GraphQL variables:

```json
{
  "downstreamServerGraphQLEndpointURL": "{ Gato GraphQL public endpoint on provisional site. Eg: https://translation-es.instawp.xyz/graphql }",
  "username": "{ Username on the provisional site, with `create_posts` capability }",
  "userPassword": "{ Password for that username }",
  "postSlug": "{ The slug of the post to sync }"
}
```

The **provisional site** will now contain the Google-Translated post.

You can now ask the translator to log-in to the **provisional site** and fix the translation, directly within the WordPress editor.

When finished, import the final translated post to your production site for that language.

Voil√†! You have used independent environments to produce your content, translate it, and deploy it.
