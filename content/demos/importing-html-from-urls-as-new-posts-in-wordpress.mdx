Provide a list of URLs from any website to Gato GraphQL, and these will be imported as new posts in your WordPress site, passing a regular expression to customize what content to fetch:

<div className="aspect-video lg:-ml-32 lg:-mr-32">
  <iframe
    className="w-full h-full"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqr5N8YBEXA"
    title="Importing HTML from URLs as new posts in WordPress"
    width="768"
    height="432"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
