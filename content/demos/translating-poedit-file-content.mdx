We can use Gato GraphQL to translate all the empty strings in a Poedit file, to easily create the translations for our themes and plugins for any language. The translated file is stored in Filestack, from where we can then download it.

In the demo video, we access the `.po` or `.pot` Poedit file from some URL, and execute the [persisted query **Translate Poedit file content**](/library/translate-poedit-file-content) (already available by the Gato GraphQL plugin), which extracts empty strings from the Poedit file, translates them to the desired language by executing a single request to the Google Translate API, and uploads the new translated Poedit file to Filestack.

The response includes entry `uploadedFileURL` with the URL of the translated file on Filestack, from where we can download it. Opening the translated file on Poedit, we can then compile it to `.mo`, and include this file in our theme or plugin.
