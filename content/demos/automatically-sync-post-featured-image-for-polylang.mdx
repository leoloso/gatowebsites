This demo is a continuation of **[Automatically synchronizing translations for a post's tags and categories for Polylang](/demos/automatically-sync-post-tags-and-categories-for-polylang)**, to also synchronize the translations for the post's featured image (in addition to translating the content, and synchronizing the tags and categories).

It uses the integration with the **Polylang** plugin (and **Polylang PRO**), and connects to the **Google Translate API**.

In the demo video, Polylang is configured with 3 languages: English (set as the default), Spanish and French, and we have a post that has alredy been translated to all three languages (following the previous demo).

We edit the post in English, and assign featured image. We then execute [persisted query **Sync featured image for Polylang**](/library/sync-tags-and-categories-for-polylang) (already available by the Gato GraphQL plugin).

Since the featured image only have an English version, both the Spanish and French translation will not receive any of these.

Then we translate featured image for Spanish and execute the persisted GraphQL query again. As a result, the Spanish post will have received the corresponding Spanish translations for the featured image.

Finally we automate the process. By publishing [automation](/features/automation) rule **Polylang: When publishing a post, set the featured image for each language on all translation posts**, whenever the origin post in English is updated, all featured image will be automatically synchronized, for all translation posts.

We then translate featured image to French, and update the origin post in English (twice). As a result, the post in French will now have the corresponding featured image in French.
