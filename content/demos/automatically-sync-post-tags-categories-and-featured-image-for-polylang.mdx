This demo is a continuation of **[Automatically translating posts for Polylang](/demos/automatically-translate-posts-for-polylang-gutenberg)**, to also synchronize the translations for the post's tags, categories, and featured image (in addition to translating the content).

It uses the integration with the **Polylang** plugin (and **Polylang PRO**) and connecting to the **Google Translate API**.

In the demo video, Polylang is configured with 3 languages: English (set as the default), Spanish and French, and we have a post that has been translated to all three languages (following the previous demo).

We edit once again the post in English, and assign tags and categories. We then execute [persisted query **Sync tags and categories for Polylang**](/library/sync-tags-and-categories-for-polylang) (already available by the Gato GraphQL plugin).

Since the tags and categories only have an English version, both the Spanish and French translation will not receive any.

Then we add translations to Spanish and execute the query again. We will now see that the Spanish post has received the corresponding Spanish translations for the tags and categories.

Finally we automate the process, by publishing automation rule **Polylang: When publishing a post, set the tags and categories for each language on all translation posts**. From now on, whenever updating the origin post in English, all tags and categories will be automatically synchronized to all translation posts.

To demonstrate, we now create the translations for Frech for tags and categories, and update the post (twice). As a result, the post in French will now have the corresponding tags and categories in French.

Then we automate the process, by publishing automation rule **Polylang: When publishing a post, translate it to all languages (Gutenberg)** (already available by Gato GraphQL PRO, with `draft` status so it is disabled by default), which automatically translates the post to all languages, and stores the translations in the corresponding translation posts.

The automation will update translation posts with `draft` status only (by default). As the Spanish translation post is changed to `publish`, its contents will not be updated anymore when the origin content in English is modified.
