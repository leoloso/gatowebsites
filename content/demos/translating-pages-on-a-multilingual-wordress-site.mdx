We can use Gato GraphQL to create a multilingual site based on a [WordPress multisite network](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/multisite/create-network/) (where every site is the translation for some language) without the need for any other plugin.

In this video, we translate pages from the origin site, and automatically create them on the translation site:

<div className="aspect-video lg:-ml-32 lg:-mr-32">
  <iframe
    className="w-full h-full"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uPbGVDLB9Lg"
    title="Translating pages on a Multilingual WordPress site"
    width="768"
    height="432"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  >
  </iframe>
</div>

, with support for the Gutenberg block editor, and the Classic editor

In the demo video, Polylang is configured with 3 languages: English (set as the default), Spanish and French.

We first translate a block-based post to all languages by running [persisted query **Translate posts for Polylang (Gutenberg)**](/library/translate-posts-for-polylang-gutenberg) (already available by the Gato GraphQL plugin).

Then we automate the process, by publishing [automation](/features/automation) rule **Polylang: When publishing a post, translate it to all languages (Gutenberg)** (already available by Gato GraphQL PRO, with `draft` status so it is disabled by default), which automatically translates the post to all languages, and stores the translations in the corresponding translation posts.

The automation will update translation posts with `draft` status only (by default). As the Spanish translation post is changed to `publish`, its contents will not be updated anymore when the origin content in English is modified.
