We can use Gato GraphQL to automatically send a notification email to all users subscribed to an email list, whenever a new post is created on the site:

<div className="aspect-video lg:-ml-32 lg:-mr-32">
  <iframe
    className="w-full h-full"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOwZyw71TyA"
    title="Automatically sending an email to all subscribers notifying of a new post"
    width="768"
    height="432"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  >
  </iframe>
</div>

In the demo video, website users are subscribed to email lists. This is done by storing user meta `email_list` (which is an array of list names). Users that need to be notified that there is a new post on the site are those with meta value `new_posts`.
