Would you like to develop extensions for Gato GraphQL, and make money off it?

The Developer Partnership Program invites developers to collaborate in the creation of commercial extensions for Gato GraphQL, and share the profits.

## How does it work?

The Gato GraphQL plugin can be augmented via the [extensions](/extensions/) shipped via Gato GraphQL PRO, which add more functionality and expand the GraphQL schema.

We aim to have integrations with all the popular WordPress plugins, including:

- WooCommerce
- Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)
- Yoast SEO
- Rank Math
- Gravity Forms
- Easy Digital Downloads
- Others

We invite developers to choose from any of these integrations, or propose any other one of your interest, and create the corresponding extension for Gato GraphQL.

## What is our role?

The Gato GraphQL team will support you with:

- Creating the extension project and setting-up its structure
- Providing relevant documentation
- Providing PHP code examples to develop the functionality
- Guiding you throughout the development process
- Helping you troubleshoot issues

We will also promote and sell the extension via Gato GraphQL PRO.

## What are your responsibilities?

As the extension developer, your task is to deliver the integration with the chosen 3rd-party plugin, maintain it, and (optionally) promote it.

### Create the extension

The integration with the 3rd-party plugin needs to deliver all agreed-upon features, i.e. it needs to add the expected types, fields and mutations to the GraphQL schema, to query/mutate data from that plugin.

These do not need to be 100% comprehensive of the functionality of the plugin. As long as these satisfy an actual problem, they can deliver just a subset of the GraphQL schema for that plugin.

For instance, an integration with WooCommerce could initially only include the `Product` type with the `price` field. And that could be good enough to ship the first version of the extension. Later on, in further iterations, it could also add the `updateProduct` mutation. Then, the `Customer` type. Further, the `Variation` type and the `updateVariation` mutation. And so on.

The profit you make is based on the number and complexity of the features included in the extension. When later on the integration is expanded, the profits will be accordingly increased.

### Maintain the extension

Development of the extension must be ongoing:

- Fix bugs
- Make sure it works with newer versions of WordPress, and fix if not
- Make sure it works with newer versions of the 3rd-party plugin, and fix if not
- Add new features (based on your own needs, requirements by the community, etc)

### Promote the extension (optional)

You're welcome to promote the extension in your channels. We can also cross-promote, and collaborate in campaigns.

## Can you also be an affiliate?

Yes, you can also be an affiliate. Then you will get the 25% commission when selling others' products, plus the profits from your extension.
