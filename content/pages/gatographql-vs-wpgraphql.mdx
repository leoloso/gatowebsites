If you just need to build a headless WordPress site and deploy it as static, and you're currently using [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com), switching to Gato GraphQL will not make any difference.

Otherwise, switching to Gato GraphQL provides many additional benefits.

## How is Gato GraphQL better than WPGraphQL?

Let's see what benefits Gato GraphQL + Gato GraphQL PRO provide, that WPGraphQL does not.

### Security

You can use [persisted queries](/features/persisted-queries) to expose predefined data, and completely disable the GraphQL single endpoint, for better security.

You can validate that only logged-in users, or users with a certain role or capability, or visitors from a certain IP range, [can access data](/features/access-control), on a field-by-field basis (PRO).

### Speed

You can cache the GraphQL response using standard [HTTP caching](/features/http-caching) (PRO).

### Endpoint customization and management

You can provide multiple [custom endpoints](/features/custom-endpoints), each of them customized for your customers or applications, [protecting them via a password](/features/public-private-and-password-protected-endpoints).

And you can [add custom categories](/features/endpoint-management) to them, and [give them a hierarchy](/features/api-hierarchy) (such as `/graphql/customers/some-customer` and `/graphql/customers/another-customer`).

### Bulk updates

You can execute updates in bulk. For instance, you can delete all comments on the site, or assign a tag or category to all your posts.

And you can search and replace a string on hundreds of posts, for instance to [replace an old with the new domain](/library/replace-the-old-domain-with-a-new-domain-in-all-posts), and even [using a regex](/library/regex-search-and-replace-multiple-strings-in-all-posts) (PRO).

### Custom GraphQL features

You will have access to novel GraphQL features, proposed for the spec but not yet released, including [nested mutations](/features/nested-mutations), [schema namespacing](/features/schema-namespacing) and the ['oneOf' Input Object](/features/oneof-input-object).

And also [dynamic variables and Multiple Query Execution](/features/multiple-query-execution) (PRO).

### GraphQL server availability

You can expose private endpoints to power your Gutenberg blocks. And you can [access a private GraphQL server](/extensions/internal-graphql-server), to fetch data for your application using PHP code, without exposing any public-facing endpoint (PRO).

### Versatility on mutating data

You can use GraphQL to retrieve, modify and finally store again the content in your site, all within a single GraphQL document (PRO).

For instance, you can fetch all the Gutenberg blocks in a post, extract their properties, [translate those strings via Google Translate API](/library/translate-post-gutenberg), insert those strings back into the block, and store the post again.

### Extended functionality

You can use GraphQL to [import posts from another WordPress site](/library/import-post-from-wp-site), [from an RSS feed](/library/import-post-from-wp-rss-feed), [from a CSV](/library/import-posts-from-csv), or from any REST or GraphQL API.

And you can [export content to another WordPress site](/library/export-post-to-wp-site), and store it as JSON and CSV(PRO).

You can invoke the API of any external service via an [HTTP client](/features/http-client) (PRO). For instance, you can [subscribe your WordPress users to your Mailchimp email list](/library/subscribe-email-on-mailchimp-list).

### Automation

You can use GraphQL to [automate tasks and content workflows](/features/automation) (PRO).

For instance, when a new post is created (event `wp_insert_post`) you can execute a persisted query that checks if the post does not have a thumbnail and, in that case, [generates an image by calling the Stable Diffusion API](/library/generate-an-optimized-post-featured-image-using-stable-diffusion-and-tinypng), compresses it via TinyPng, and finally inserts the image as the post's featured image.

### Ease of access to functionality

All of these additional uses cases can be achieved directly within the wp-admin, providing the GraphQL query via a user interface, without having to deploy any PHP code.
