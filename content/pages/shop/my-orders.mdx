## Upgrading bundles and extensions

While your purchased product's license is active, the download file (available in <a href="https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders" target="_blank">My orders @LemonSqueezy&#x2197;</a>) will be the most up-to-date one.

Whenever the Gato GraphQL plugin releases a new version, bundles and extensions may also release a new, corresponding upgrade, with the same version number. Check if there is such an update and, if so, download it and install it on your WordPress site.
