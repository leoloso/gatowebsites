With the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/" rel="nofollow">WP REST API</a>, you expose data via REST endpoints, created via PHP code. Each endpoint has its own URL, and its data is pre-defined (for the corresponding resources, such as posts, users, etc).

Gato GraphQL supports [Persisted Queries](/features/persisted-queries), which are also endpoints with pre-defined data, however these can be created and published directly within the wp-admin, using GraphQL language (and without any PHP code).

With Gato GraphQL you can also execute tailored GraphQL queries against an endpoint, indicating what specific data you need, and fetching only that within a single request.
