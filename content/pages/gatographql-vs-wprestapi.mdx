Let's analyze how Gato GraphQL + Gato GraphQL PRO compares against the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/" rel="nofollow">WP REST API</a>.

## Accessing predefined data

With the WP REST API, you expose data via REST endpoints. Each endpoint has its own URL, and its data is pre-defined (for the corresponding resources, such as posts or users).

Similar to REST endpoints, Gato GraphQL supports [Persisted Queries](/features/persisted-queries), which are also endpoints with pre-defined data. Requesting a persisted query via `GET` will execute the stored GraphQL query, and produce the expected `JSON` response:

The difference between them is that while REST API endpoints are created via PHP code, and must be deployed within a theme or plugin, Gato GraphQL persisted queries are created using the [GraphQL language](https://graphql.org), and are published via a WordPress editor-powered user interface within the wp-admin, without the need to deploy any code.

The same caching mechanisms can be applied to REST endpoints and GraphQL persisted queries. Since the persisted query is accessed under its own endpoint, its response can be cached using standard [HTTP caching](/features/http-caching) (PRO).

## Accessing non-predefined data

With GraphQL you can execute a tailored GraphQL query against an endpoint, indicating what specific data you need, and fetching only that within a single request.

For instance, the following GraphQL query will fetch the required data for a specific post, including data from its relationships (the author, categories and tags), all within a single request:

```graphql
query {
  post(by: { id: 1 }) {
    title
    content
    url
    date
    author {
      id
      name
    }
    categories {
      id
      name
    }
    tags {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

In contrast, a REST API might need to execute a first request to fetch the post data, and a subsequent request for each of its relationships to fetch their data.

## Access control

Restricting data in the WP REST API depends on the `context` parameter. Passing `?context=view` produces data for unauthenticated users, and `?context=edit` includes additional data for authenticated users (with the right permissions), such as the post's `content.raw` field.

Gato GraphQL provides much more flexibility, with every single field being either accessible or not based on [Access Control](/features/access-control) rules. You can validate that only logged-in users, or users with a certain role or capability, or visitors from a certain IP range, can access a specific field (PRO).
