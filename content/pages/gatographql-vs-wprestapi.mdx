Let's analyze how Gato GraphQL compares against the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/" rel="nofollow">WP REST API</a>.

## Accessing predefined data

With the WP REST API, you expose data via REST endpoints. Each endpoint has its own URL, and its data is pre-defined (for the corresponding resources, such as posts, users, etc).

Similar to REST endpoints, Gato GraphQL supports [Persisted Queries](/features/persisted-queries), which are also endpoints with pre-defined data.

Requesting a persisted query via `GET` will execute the stored GraphQL query, and produce the expected `JSON` response:

/>

The difference between them is that while REST API endpoints are created via PHP code, and must be deployed within a theme or plugin, Gato GraphQL persisted queries are created using the [GraphQL language](https://graphql.org), and are published via a WordPress editor-powered user interface within the wp-admin, without the need to deploy any code.

## Accessing only the needed data

With Gato GraphQL you can also execute tailored GraphQL queries against an endpoint, indicating what specific data you need, and fetching only that within a single request.
