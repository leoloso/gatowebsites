Mutation fields can be configured to return either of these 2 different entity types:

- A payload object type
- Directly the mutated entity

A **payload object type** contains all the data concerning the mutation:

- The status of the mutation (success or failure)
- The errors (if any) using distinctive GraphQL types, or
- The successfully mutated entity

For instance, mutation `updatePost` returns an object of type `PostUpdateMutationPayload`, and we still need to query its field `post` to retrieve the updated post entity:

```graphql
mutation UpdatePost {
  updatePost(input: {
    id: 1724,
    title: "New title",
    status: publish
  }) {
    # This is the status of the mutation: SUCCESS or FAILURE
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
    post {
      id
      title
      # This is the status of the post: publish, pending, trash, etc
      status
    }
  }
}
```

In this mode, the GraphQL schema will contain plenty of additional `MutationPayload`, `MutationErrorPayloadUnion` and `ErrorPayload` types, so it will have a bigger size:

With the **mutated entity** type, the mutation will directly return the mutated entity in case of success, or <code>null</code> in case of failure, and any error message will be displayed in the JSON response's top-level <code>errors</code> entry.

For instance, mutation `updatePost` will return the object of type `Post`:

```graphql
mutation UpdatePost {
  updatePost(input: {
    id: 1724,
    title: "New title",
    status: publish
  }) {
    id
    title
    status
  }
}
```

Because there are no additional types added, the GraphQL schema will look leaner:
