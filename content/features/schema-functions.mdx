The GraphQL schema is provided with fields and directives which expose functionalities from the PHP programming language.

## HTTP Client

The GraphQL schema is provided with global fields to execute HTTP requests against a webserver and fetch their response.

Due to security reasons, the URLs that can be connected to must be explicitly configured (explained in [Configuring what URLs can be HTTP-requested](/guides/config/configuring-what-urls-can-be-http-requested)).

This query:

```graphql
query {
  postData: _sendJSONObjectItemHTTPRequest(input: {
    url: "https://some-wp-rest-api.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/1/"
  } )
}
```

...retrieves this response:

```json

  "data": {
    "postData": {
      "id": 1,
      "date": "2019-08-02T07:53:57",

    }
  }
}
```

## Function Fields

Function fields are **Global Fields**, hence they are added to every single type in the GraphQL schema: in `QueryRoot`, but also in `Post`, `User`, etc.

Function fields are useful for manipulating the data once it has been retrieved, allowing us to transform a field value in whatever way it is required, and granting us powerful data import/export capabilities.

For instance, while we have a `Post.hasComments` fields, we may need the opposite value. Instead of creating a new field `Post.notHasComments` (for which we'd need to edit PHP code), we can use the **Field to Input** feature to input the value from `hasComments` into a `not` field, thus calculating the new value always within the GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    id
    hasComments
    notHasComments: _not(value: $__hasComments)
  }
}
```

## Function Directives

The GraphQL schema is provided with directives which expose functionalities commonly found in programming languages (such as PHP).

Directive fields are useful for manipulating the data once it has been retrieved, allowing us to transform a field value in whatever way it is required, and granting us powerful data import/export capabilities.

For instance, this query:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    title @strUpperCase
  }
}
```

...will produce this response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "title": "HELLO WORLD!"
      },
      {
        "title": "LOVELY WEATHER"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Helper Fields

The GraphQL schema is added fields which provide commonly-used helper functionality.

Helper fields are **Global Fields**, hence they are added to every single type in the GraphQL schema: in `QueryRoot`, but also in `Post`, `User`, etc.

For instance, in combination with the **Inspect HTTP Request Fields** and **Field to Input** modules, we can retrieve the currently-requested URL when executing a GraphQL custom endpoint or persisted query, add extra parameters, and send another HTTP request to the new URL.

In this query, we retrieve the IDs of the users in the website and execute a new GraphQL query passing their ID as parameter:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    userID: id
    url: _urlAddParams(
      url: "https://somewebsite/endpoint/user-data",
      params: {
        userID: $__userID
      }
    )
    headers: _httpRequestHeaders
    headerNameValueEntryList: _objectConvertToNameValueEntryList(
      object: $__headers
    )
    _sendHTTPRequest(input: {
      url: $__url
      options: {
        headers: $__headerNameValueEntryList
      }
    }) {
      statusCode
      contentType
      body
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Fields

The GraphQL schema is provided with global field `_env`, which allows to obtain a value from an environment variable, or from a PHP constant (most commonly defined in `wp-config.php`, but can also be defined elsewhere).

Due to security reasons, the name of the environment variable and constants that can be accessed must be explicitly configured (explained in [Configuring what environment variables and PHP constants can be queried](/guides/config/configuring-what-environment-variables-and-php-constants-can-be-queried)).

Field `_env` receives the name of the environment variable or constant under parameter `"name"`, and is resolved like this:

- If there is an environment variable with that name, it returns it
- Otherwise, if there is a constant with that name, it returns it
- Otherwise, it returns `null` and adds an error to the GraphQL output.

For instance, this query retrieves the environment constant `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` which we might set-up to access a private repository in GitHub:

```graphql
query {
  githubAccessToken: _env(name: "GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN")
}
```

## Security: Not exposing credentials

Please read guide [Security: Avoid exposing credentials used in the query](/guides/interact/security-avoid-exposing-credentials-used-in-the-query).

## Further examples

This query retrieves the DB configuration defined in the `wp-config.php` file:

```graphql
query {
  dbName: _env(name: "DB_NAME")
  dbUser: _env(name: "DB_USER")
  dbPassword: _env(name: "DB_PASSWORD")
  dbHost: _env(name: "DB_HOST")
}
```
