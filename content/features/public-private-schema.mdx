What should happen when a user without access to some field or directive in the schema, attempts to access it?

With the **public/private API mode** we can control the desired behavior:

In the **public API**, the fields in the schema are exposed, and when the permission is not satisfied, the user gets an error message with a description of why the permission was rejected.

In the **private API**, the schema is customized to every user, containing only the fields available to him or her, and so when attempting to access a forbidden field, the error message says that the field doesn't exist.
