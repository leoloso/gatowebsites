In a **REST** API, we create multiple endpoints, each returning a pre-defined set of data. In a **GraphQL** API, in contrast, we provide any query to a single endpoint, which returns exactly the requested data.

**Persisted queries** are normal GraphQL queries, however they are stored in the server and accessed under their own URL, thus emulating a REST endpoint. They provide the advantages from these two APIs, while avoiding their disadvantages:

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Accessed via `GET` or `POST` | ~~❌ Accessed only via `POST`~~ |
| ✅ Can be cached on the server or CDN | ~~❌ Needs to provide an extra layer in client-side just for caching~~ |
| ✅ It's secure: only intended data is exposed | ~~❌ Data is exposed to anyone, including malicious actors~~ |
| ✅ No under/over fetching of data, all data is retrieved in a single request | ~~❌ It can be slow, since the application may need several requests to retrieve all the data~~ |
| ✅ It enables rapid iteration of the project | ~~❌ It's tedious to create all the endpoints~~ |
| ✅ It can be self-documented | ~~❌ Producing documentation is mandatory~~ |
| ✅ It provides clients to create and publish the query | ~~❌ Publishing endpoints is done via code~~ |
