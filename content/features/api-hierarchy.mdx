An API may expose several endpoints which are somehow related to each other, and which may execute a similar query. This is the case, for instance, when creating endpoints that exposes the data in one language or another.

Through the **API Hierarchy** we can define a structure for endpoints, so that we can produce:

- `/graphql/posts/english/`
- `/graphql/posts/french/`

In this case, a parent query `posts` can provide the GraphQL query, and its descendant queries `english` and `french` provide the variables to customize the query.
