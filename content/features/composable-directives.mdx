Oftentimes, a directive cannot be applied on a field, because it has an input which is different than the field's output. For instance, directive `@strUpperCase` receives a string as input, so it can't be applied on field `User.capabilities`, which returns an array of strings.

With **composable directives**, a directive can augment another directive to modify its behavior or fill a gap. This removes the need to duplicate fields or directives just to change their input or return types, avoiding bloat.

In this query, directive `@underEachArrayItem` iterates over an array of strings, and applies its nested directive `@strUpperCase` on each of them, fixing the type mismatch:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    capabilities
      @underEachArrayItem
        @strUpperCase
  }
}
```
