{/* ðŸ“£ **Note:** This feature is unlocked by the [Field Deprecation](/extensions/field-deprecation) extension. */}

GraphQL does not version an endpoint, as it happens in REST. Instead, it makes the schema evolve, by allowing you to deprecate fields.

Deprecation is standard GraphQL behavior, but is normally executed via code. Through the **Field deprecation** user interface, we can already deprecate fields, without the need to deploy any code.
