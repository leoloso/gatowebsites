If plugins WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads both implemented a `Product` type for the GraphQL API, then we could not install both plugins at the same time, since their types would conflict.

**Schema namespacing** enables to avoid conflicts in the schema, by having all type names namespaced. Hence, type `Product` would become `Woo_Product` and `EDD_Product` respectively, and these types could be added to the same schema.

This images shows a namespaced schema, in which types `Event` and `Location` were added the prefix `EM_` to avoid name collision:
