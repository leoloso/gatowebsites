The GraphQL schema is added fields which provide commonly-used helper functionality.

Helper fields are **Global Fields**, hence they are added to every single type in the GraphQL schema: in `QueryRoot`, but also in `Post`, `User`, etc.

## Examples

In combination with the **Inspect HTTP Request Fields** and **Field to Input** modules, we can retrieve the currently-requested URL when executing a GraphQL custom endpoint or persisted query, add extra parameters, and send another HTTP request to the new URL.

For instance, in this query, we retrieve the IDs of the users in the website and execute a new GraphQL query passing their ID as parameter:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    userID: id
    url: _urlAddParams(
      url: "https://somewebsite/endpoint/user-data",
      params: {
        userID: $__userID
      }
    )
    headers: _httpRequestHeaders
    headerNameValueEntryList: _objectConvertToNameValueEntryList(
      object: $__headers
    )
    _sendHTTPRequest(input: {
      url: $__url
      options: {
        headers: $__headerNameValueEntryList
      }
    }) {
      statusCode
      contentType
      body
    }
  }
}
```
