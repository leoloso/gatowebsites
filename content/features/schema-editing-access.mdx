{/* ðŸ“£ **Note:** This feature is unlocked by the [Schema Editing Access](/extensions/schema-editing-access) extension. */}

By default, only admin users (those with the `manage_options` capability) have access to the different screens of plugin Gato GraphQL in the admin.

We can enable to grant non-admin users access to the GraphiQL and Interactive schema clients in the admin, and to read and/or write the different Custom Post Types from this plugin:

- Persisted Queries
- Custom Endpoints
- Schema Configurations
- Access Control Lists
- Cache Control Lists
- Others

This is achieved via two different methods:

1. By assigning the custom capability `manage_graphql_schema` to the user
2. By selecting the user roles that can edit the schema (down to the "Author" level)

{/* <!-- What permissions are given to non-admin users follows the same <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#summary-of-roles" target="_blank">scheme as when editing posts in WordPress</a>, where users with different roles (`subscriber`, `contributor`, `author` and `editor`) have access to different capabilities:

| Role | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Editor | Can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users |
| Author | Can publish and manage their own posts |
| Contributor | Can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them |
| Subscriber | Can only read posts |

For instance, a contributor can create, but not publish, a persisted query:
