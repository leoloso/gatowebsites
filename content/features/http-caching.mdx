{/* ðŸ“£ **Note:** This feature is unlocked by the [Cache Control](/extensions/cache-control) extension. */}

Because it sends the queries via `POST`, GraphQL is normally not cacheable on the server-side or intermediate stages between the client and the server (such as a CDN), and we need to worry about adding a caching layer on the application on the client-side, making it slower and more complex.

However, whenever accessed via `GET` (as natural for persisted queries, and using param `?query=...` otherwise), their response can be cached through standard **HTTP caching**.

We can define for how long every field or directive must be cached, and the response will include a `Cache-Control` header, whose `max-age` value is calculated automatically from all the fields and directives in the requested query (or `no-store` if it involves user state).
