When creating a Custom Endpoint or Persisted Query, we can add a "GraphQL endpoint category" to it, to organize all of our endpoints:

For instance, we can create categories to manage endpoints by client, application, or any other required piece of information:

![List of endpoint categories](/assets/guides/upstream/graphql-endpoint-categories.png "List of endpoint categories")

On the list of Custom Endpoints and Persisted Queries, we can visualize their categories and, clicking on any category link, or using the filter at the top, will only display all entries for that category:
