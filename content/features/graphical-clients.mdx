Gato GraphQL provides a multitude of graphical clients (based on the WordPress editor) to configure the GraphQL schema, set-up automation rules, define access control and cache control, and others:

  alt="Selecting the Schema Configuration in the Custom Endpoint"
  caption="Selecting the Schema Configuration in the Custom Endpoint"
/>

These clients make it very easy to interact with Gato GraphQL, directly within the wp-admin (and without the need of any PHP code), reducing friction and removing barriers so that anyone (developers and non-developers alike) can use it.
