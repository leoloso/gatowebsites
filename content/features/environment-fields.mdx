The GraphQL schema is provided with global field `_env`, which allows to obtain a value from an environment variable, or from a PHP constant (most commonly defined in `wp-config.php`, but can also be defined elsewhere).

Due to security reasons, the name of the environment variable and constants that can be accessed must be explicitly configured (explained in [Configuring what environment variables and PHP constants can be queried](/guides/config/configuring-what-environment-variables-and-php-constants-can-be-queried)).

Field `_env` receives the name of the environment variable or constant under parameter `"name"`, and is resolved like this:

- If there is an environment variable with that name, it returns it
- Otherwise, if there is a constant with that name, it returns it
- Otherwise, it returns `null` and adds an error to the GraphQL output.

For instance, this query retrieves the environment constant `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` which we might set-up to access a private repository in GitHub:

```graphql
query {
  githubAccessToken: _env(name: "GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN")
}
```

## Security: Not exposing credentials

Please read guide [Security: Avoid exposing credentials used in the query](/guides/interact/security-avoid-exposing-credentials-used-in-the-query).

## Further examples

This query retrieves the DB configuration defined in the `wp-config.php` file:

```graphql
query {
  dbName: _env(name: "DB_NAME")
  dbUser: _env(name: "DB_USER")
  dbPassword: _env(name: "DB_PASSWORD")
  dbHost: _env(name: "DB_HOST")
}
```
