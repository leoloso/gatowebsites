Version fields and directives independently from the schema.

Instead of evolving the whole schema (which requires to modify the name of the modified field or directive), we can:

- Keep different implementations under the same field or directive name
- Expose the legacy implementation under a tag, using semantic versioning
- Access a specific version through field/directive argument `versionConstraint`
