Multiple mechanisms have been put in place to help protect your data:

👉🏽 Expose pre-defined data through **persisted queries**, and avoid granting public access to the single endpoint.

👉🏽 Create **custom endpoints**, accessible only to the intended target user or application

👉🏽 The single endpoint, and clients to interact with it, **can be disabled**.

👉🏽 Grant granular access to the schema via **access control rules**, down to the operation, field and directive level.

👉🏽 Define the API to be either **public or private**.
