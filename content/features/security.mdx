Multiple mechanisms have been put in place to help protect your data:

👉🏽 Expose pre-defined data through **persisted queries**, and avoid granting public access to the single endpoint.

👉🏽 Create **custom endpoints**, accessible only to the intended target user or application

👉🏽 The single endpoint, and clients to interact with it, are **disabled by default**.

👉🏽 Which settings (from table `wp_options`) and meta values (from tables `wp_postmeta`, `wp_usermeta`, `wp_commentmeta` and `wp_taxonomymeta`) can be queried must be **explicitly defined in the configuration**.

👉🏽 Some fields and input fields are exposed as **“sensitive” data elements"**, as to provide access to private data, but have it disabled by default: public data (eg: `posts`) is accessible by default, private data from the user (`myPosts`) is available to the logged-in user, and input `status` in field `posts(filter:)` (to retrieve non-published posts) is accessible only if explicitly enabled.
