The oneOf input object is a particular type of input object, where exactly one of the input fields must be provided as input, or otherwise the server returns a validation error. This behavior introduces polymorphism for inputs in GraphQL, allowing us to design neater schemas.

For instance, retrieving a user in our application could be done by different properties, such as the user ID or email. To do this, we'd normally need to create a separate field for each property:

```graphql
type Query {
  userByID(id: ID!): User
  userByEmail(email: String!): User
}
```

Thanks to the oneOf input object, we can instead have a single field `user` that accepts all properties via a `UserByInput` oneOf input object, knowing that only one of the properties (either the ID or the email) can and must be provided:

```graphql
type Query {
  user(by: UserByInput!): User
}

input UserByInput @oneOf {
  id: ID
  email: String
}
```

In the query, we provide the input value for exactly one of the properties:

```graphql
{
  tom: user(by: {
    id: 1
  }) {
    name
  }

  jerry: user(by: {
    email: "jerry@warnerbros.com"
  }) {
    name
  }
}
```
