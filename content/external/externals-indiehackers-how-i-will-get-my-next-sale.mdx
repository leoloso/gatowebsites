What tactics I'll try next

## Creating (even more) bundles of extensions

Create extra, super customized bundles. Eg: "Email reminders"

Record videos. I have the impression that video on Content Translation convinced this guy.

## Releasing the plugin in the WordPress directory

Plugin approved! Soon to be added, yeah

## Traffic (hopefully) coming from my intended audience

## Facebook and Google ads!?

Because I hate them, I don't want to give my money.

To build an audience for my newsletter. So next time I have a campaign, I have an audience.

## Keep offering license giveaways to build an audience

why not, it's free

and maybe on the 2nd year they'll be customers

## Keep developing plenty of features for the plugin

Add a visual GUI for email templates

## Attend WordCamps, Do networking

Going to WordCamp Asia and Europe

face to face, build relationships

I need to spend money to make money

In last WC I met Vikas, and [his tweet]() got me several people to join the raffle.

## Keep engaging on Reddit and Facebook Groups

But not Twitter. Twitter is dead. It's a waste of my time. Nobody clicks on the links from Twitter. Certainly not my type.
