Connect to the **Google Translate API** within the GraphQL query, and **translate content to over 130 languages**.

Execute a GraphQL query that translates the content, and then keep editing the post within the WordPress editor. All strings are sent together in a single request to Google Translate, making the translation as accurate as possible.

Both the Gutenberg editor, and the Classic editor, are supported.

In the video: A Gutenberg post is translated from English to Spanish, and then reviewed and edited once again within the WordPress editor.
