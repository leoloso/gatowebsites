**Use GraphQL to automate tasks and content workflows in your site**, by executing a persisted query for the corresponding task, triggered via WP-Cron or WordPress action hooks.

You can automatically generate an image for posts without thumbnail, add mandatory blocks to new posts, send a notification email when there is a new comment, translate a post to multiple languages and distribute them to translation sites, and more.
