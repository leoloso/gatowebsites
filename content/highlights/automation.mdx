Use GraphQL to **automate tasks and content workflows in your site**.

Every one of the highlights by Gato GraphQL can be automated, by executing a persisted query, triggered via WP-Cron and action hooks.

For instance, whenever there is a new post on the site, check if it has a mandatory block and, if it does not, automatically add it.
