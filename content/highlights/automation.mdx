Use GraphQL to **automate tasks and content workflows in your site**.

Every one of the highlights by Gato GraphQL can be automated, by executing a persisted query, triggered via WP-Cron and action hooks.

_In the video: Whenever there is a new post on the site, the persisted query checks if the post has some mandatory block and, if it does not, automatically adds it._
