videoDesc: Visualizing the GraphQL schema with the Interactive Schema client.
---

**Several clients** are included to interact with the GraphQL server.

The **Interactive Schema** client allows you to visualize the GraphQL schema, to explore and understand how all data entities relate to each other.

The **GraphiQL client** allows you to visually compose GraphQL queries and execute them against the server, and browse the schema's documentation.
