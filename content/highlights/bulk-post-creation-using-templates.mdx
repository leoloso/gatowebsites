**Create posts in bulk based on a template and a data source**. The template can include content of any type, including Gutenberg blocks, the Classic editor, or any page builder.

Provide a template for the content of the post containing variables for dynamic data, and a source with data —such as a CSV input, or a JSON dictionary—. Then execute a GraphQL query to merge them and dynamically create the posts.
