videoDesc: We avoid coding a custom `Post.hasExcerpt` field by combining fields `Post.excerpt` and `Root._notEmpty`.

Gato GraphQL gives you the ability to **compose fields** —where the value of a field can be provided as input to another field in the same query— and **compose directives** —where a directive can modify the behavior of another directive—.

Composability means that a foundational set of field and directive resolvers are enough to cover an unlimited number of use cases, reducing the need to provide bespoke PHP code for custom functionality.
