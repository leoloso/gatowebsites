**Dynamically create posts based on templates and a data source**, creating the posts **in bulk**.

Provide a template with the HTML content for the post, and a source with custom data —such as CSV file, or a JSON dictionary—. Then execute a GraphQL query to merge them and create the posts.

The template supports content of any type: Gutenberg, Classic editor, Elementor, or any other page builder.
