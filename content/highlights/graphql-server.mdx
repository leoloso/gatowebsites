**GraphQL** is an API to retrieve exactly the data that you need, to power your WordPress themes, plugins, block and applications.

Use the GraphiQL client to execute GraphQL queries against the server and visualize the response: Provide the query and variables, and click on the Run query button. The GraphQL server will process the query, and give you a response with the requested data, in JSON format.

Then store the GraphQL query in your application, and retrieve data for it, via GraphQL.

There are plenty of things you can do with Gato GraphQL.
