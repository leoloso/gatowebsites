Gato GraphQL provides a **GraphQL server** for your WordPress site. Use **GraphQL** to retrieve exactly the data needed to power your WordPress themes, plugins, block and applications. Provide a GraphQL query, and execute it against the server to retrieve the data, in JSON format.

Clients are included to interact with the server. The GraphiQL client allows you to compose GraphQL queries, execute them, and visualize the response. The Voyager clients allows you to visualize the GraphQL schema, exploring how all data entities relate to each other.
