Gato GraphQL provides a **GraphQL server** for your WordPress site. Use **GraphQL** to retrieve exactly the data that you need, to power your WordPress themes, plugins, block and applications. Provide a GraphQL query, and execute it against the server to retrieve the needed data, in JSON format.

The GraphiQL client allows you to compose GraphQL queries, execute them against the server, and visualize the response. Store the GraphQL query in your theme, plugin or block's code, and execute it as needed.
