**GraphQL** is an API to retrieve exactly the data that you need, to power your WordPress themes, plugins, block and applications.

Use the GraphiQL client to compose GraphQL queries, execute them against the server, and visualize their response. The GraphQL server will process the query, and give you a response with the requested data, in JSON format.

This same JSON response will power your application. Store the GraphQL query in your theme, plugin or block's code, and execute it as needed.
