**Synchronize and distribute content across multiple WordPress sites** —whether within a multisite or across independent sites—, and also include non-WordPress sites that offer an API.

Copy posts to a staging site and back to a production site, distribute articles from a single source of truth of content, have 3rd-party workers review your content without giving them access to your backend, and more.
