**Persisted GraphQL queries** combine all the benefits from GraphQL and REST APIs. Use the GraphQL language to compose the query directly from the wp-admin, and publish it under its own endpoint URL, similar to a REST endpoint.

Then access the endpoint URL in your application to retrieve the data. Since the response is predefined, visitors won't be able to freely query your data, making your application more secure.
