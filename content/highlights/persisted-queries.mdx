**Persisted queries** combine all the benefits from GraphQL and REST APIs. A persisted query is a GraphQL query that is stored on the WordPress site, and similar to a REST endpoint, it is published under its own URL.

Compose and publish a persisted GraphQL query directly from the wp-admin. Then grab its URL, and paste it into your application to retrieve the needed data. Since the response's data is predefined, you won't be allowing visitors to freely browse your data, making your application more secure.
