**Persisted queries** combine all the benefits from GraphQL and REST APIs. A persisted query is a GraphQL query that is stored on the WordPress site, and similar to a REST endpoint, it is published under its own URL.

Compose and publish a persisted GraphQL query directly from the wp-admin. Then grab its URL, and paste it into your application to retrieve the needed data.

Since the response's data is predefined, you can avoid exposing a public API endpoint for visitors, making your application more secure.
