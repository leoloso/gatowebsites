Gato GraphQL provides more options than simply exposing the GraphQL single endpoint.

In addition to **public endpoints**, you can also create **private endpoints** —to be accessed by the admin user within the wp-admin only—, and **protect a public endpoint with a password** —to be accessed by some specific stakeholder, such as a customer—.
