title: Public, Private & Password-Protected Endpoints

videoDesc: We create a custom endpoint and make it password-protected. When accessing its GraphiQL client, a prompt requests for the password. Only after providing the password, can the GraphiQL client and the GraphQL endpoint be accessed.

In addition to exposing the GraphQL single endpoint, Gato GraphQL allows you to create **custom endpoints**, which you can set as **private** —to be accessed within the wp-admin only—, and **protect them with a password** —to be accessed by a specific stakeholder, such as a customer—.
