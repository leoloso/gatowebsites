videoDesc: We create a custom endpoint and make it password-protected. When first accessing its client to visualize the schema, we obtain an error message. Only after providing the password, the client can be successfully accessed.

In addition to exposing the GraphQL single endpoint, Gato GraphQL allows you to create **custom endpoints**, which you can set as **private** —to be accessed within the wp-admin only—, and **protect them with a password** —to be accessed by a specific stakeholder, such as a customer—.
