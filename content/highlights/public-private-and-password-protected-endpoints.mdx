videoDesc: We create a custom endpoint and make it password-protected. When first accessing its client to visualize the schema, we obtain an error message. Only after providing the password, the client can be successfully accessed.

Gato GraphQL provides more options than simply exposing the GraphQL single endpoint.

In addition to **public endpoints**, you can also create **private endpoints** —to be accessed by the admin user within the wp-admin only—, and **protect a public endpoint with a password** —to be accessed by some specific stakeholder, such as a customer—.
