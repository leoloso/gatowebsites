**Multiple query execution** combines multiple GraphQL queries together and executes them as a single operation. Queries in the document can share state with each other, and be conditionally executed depending on the value of some variable.

This feature improves the performance of the application, as it avoids the latency from waiting for the response from executing multiple requests, and allows you to organize your GraphQL queries into logical units.
