**Multiple query execution** combines multiple GraphQL queries together and executes them as a single operation. Queries in the document can share state with each other, and be conditionally executed depending on the value of some variable.

Multiple query execution improves the application's performance, as it avoids the latency from waiting for the response from executing multiple requests, and organizes the code into logical units.
