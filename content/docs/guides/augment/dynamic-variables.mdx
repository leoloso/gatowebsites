The GraphQL query below receives variable `$limit` to know how many posts to retrieve, and the type of the variable, `Int`, must be declared in the operation:

```graphql
query GetPosts($limit: Int) {
  posts(limit: $limit) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

This is the expected behavior in GraphQL, in which we provide the variable value in a JSON dictionary defined in the same document:

```json
{
  "limit": 3
}
```

This is "static" behavior, shared by many languages. In PHP, for instance, the function arguments can indicate their type, as in the code below, where input `$number` is defined to be an integer:

```php
function double(int $number): int
{
  return $number * 2;
}
```

Now, when declaring a variable within the body of the PHP function, we do not indicate its type; the variable's type is determined by the context in which the variable is used. In the code below, assigning an integer value to `$double` will make this variable be an integer:

```php
function double(int $number): int
{
  // This var is an integer, but we don't need to declare it
  $double = $number * 2;
  return $double;
}
```

Thanks to custom directives, the GraphQL server can provide a similar behavior and support dynamic variables, where a dynamic variable has its value obtained when resolving the query in the server, instead of being provided by the client.

The **[Multiple Query Execution](/extensions/multiple-query-execution/)** extension of Gato GraphQL ships with custom directive `@export`, which allows exporting the value of a field into a (dynamic) variable, and then we can read the value of this variable in a field argument from a different operation:

```graphql
query ExportLoggedInUserName {
  me {
    name @export(as: "userName")
  }
}

query GetPostsContainingString
  @depends(on: "ExportLoggedInUserName")
{
  posts(filter: { search: $userName }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

The variable `$userName` is dynamic, and there is no need to define its type (`String`) in the operation that uses it (`GetPostsContainingString`). The GraphQL server already understands the context.

If we attempt to use the variable value with a mismatching type, as in the following query (where an `Int` is expected but the dynamic variable is a `String`):

```graphql
query ExportDynamicVariable {
  _echo(value: "Hello world!") @export(as: "stringVar") # Exported: String
}

query UseVariable
  @depends(on: "ExportDynamicVariable")
{
  posts(
    pagination: {
      limit: $stringVar # Expected: Int, received: String
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

...then the GraphQL server fails [coercing the value](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Coercing-Variable-Values), and returns an error:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Cannot cast value 'Hello world!' for type 'Int'",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 10,
          "column": 13
        }
      ],
      "extensions": {
        "path": [
          "{limit: $stringVar}",
          "(pagination: {limit: $stringVar})",
          "posts(pagination: {limit: $stringVar}) { ... }",
          "query UseVariable @depends(on: \"ExportDynamicVariable\") { ... }"
        ],
        "type": "QueryRoot",
        "field": "posts(pagination: {limit: $stringVar}) { ... }",
        "id": "root",
        "code": "gql@5.6.1[16]",
        "specifiedBy": "https:\/\/spec.graphql.org\/draft\/#sec-Values-of-Correct-Type"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## GraphQL spec

This functionality is currently not part of the GraphQL spec, but it has been requested in:
