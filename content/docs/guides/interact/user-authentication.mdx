description: This is how to log the user in when executing a GraphQL query against the server.

The GraphQL query to execute may require the user to be logged-in, for instance to execute a mutation to create a post.

There are several ways to authenticate the user in.

## Using the GraphiQL client within WordPress

Because WordPress uses cookie-based user authentication, whenever we are logged-in to the WordPress site, we can simply open the GraphiQL client and execute GraphQL queries from there: As the cookies sent to the GraphQL request are the same as those from the WordPress site, the user will be already logged-in.

## `loginUser` mutation

In the same GraphQL query to execute the required mutation, we can use the `loginUser` mutation to authenticate the user.

Please notice that the order matters: `loginUser` must be added before the other mutation (in this case, `createPost`):

```graphql
mutation {
  loginUser(
    by: {
      credentials: {
        usernameOrEmail: "myusername",
        password: "mypassword"
      }
    }
  ) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
      ...on GenericErrorPayload {
        code
      }
    }
    userID
  }

  createPost(input: {
    title: "Hello world!"
    contentAs: {
      html: "<p>How are you?</p>"
    }
  }) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
    post {
      id
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```
