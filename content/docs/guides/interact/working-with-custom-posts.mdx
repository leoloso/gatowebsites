We use fields `customPost` and `customPosts` to fetch CPT data, both for CPTs that are mapped to the schema (such as `Post` and `Page`) or not (such as a CPT from some plugin). Because the results can include entities from different types, these fields return the `CustomPostUnion` type.

## Custom Post fields in the schema

Gato GraphQL makes a clear distinction of when a custom post is a "custom post", and not directly a "post".

For instance, a comment can be added to a post, but also to a page and to a CPT, hence type `Comment` has field `customPost: CustomPostUnion!` to retrieve the entity where the comment was added, instead of field `post: Post!`.

![`Comment` type](/assets/guides/upstream/interactive-schema-comment.png "`Comment` type")

That's also why field `customPosts` receives argument `customPostTypes` instead of `postTypes`.

## CPTs mapped to the schema

There are CPTs which have been mapped to the schema (such as `Post` and `Page` to represent CPTs `"post"` and `"page"`). In this case, the query will be resolved using the corresponding GraphQL type for that CPT.

When fetching results from a union type, we need to specify the fields to retrieve through fragments. These can be evaluated on interface `CustomPost`, which is implemented by all CPT types, or on each individual type, such as `Post` or `Page`.

In the query below, we fetch custom posts with CPTs `"post"` and `"page"`. We display their fields through 3 fragments, which evaluate if the entity implements `CustomPost`, or is of type `Post` or `Page`:

```graphql
query {
  customPosts(filter: { customPostTypes: ["post", "page"] }) {
    ...CustomPostProps
    ...PostProps
    ...PageProps
  }
}

fragment CustomPostProps on CustomPost {
  __typename
  title
  excerpt
  url
  dateStr(format: "d/m/Y")
}

fragment PostProps on Post {
  tags {
    id
    name
  }
}

fragment PageProps on Page {
  author {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## CPTs not mapped to the schema

When a CPT has not been mapped to the schema yet (such as `"attachment"`, `"revision"` or `"nav_menu_item"`, or any CPT installed by any plugin), we still use fields `customPost` and `customPosts`, and we must pass the corresponding CPT name under the `filter.customPostTypes` field arg.

Because their types do not exist in the schema, their data will be retrieved via type `GenericCustomPost`, which contains all the common properties to CPTs (title, content, excerpt, date, etc).

![Generic Custom Post](/assets/guides/downstream/query/interactive-schema-generic-custom-post.png "Generic Custom Post")

In the query below, we fetch custom posts for a variety of CPTs:

```graphql
query {
  customPosts(
    filter:{
      customPostTypes: [
        "page",
        "nav_menu_item",
        "wp_block",
        "wp_global_styles"
      ]
    }
  ) {
    ... on CustomPost {
      id
      title
      customPostType
      status
    }
    __typename
  }
}
```

## Allowing access to Custom Post Types

CPTs must be explicitly allowed to be queryable, as explained in guide [Allowing access to Custom Post Types](/guides/config/allowing-access-to-custom-post-types).

## Querying custom posts

The GraphQL types for CPTs which have been mapped to the schema (such as `"post"` => `Post` and `"page"` => `Page`) are incorporated directly into `CustomPostUnion`.

For any CPT that has not been modeled in the schema (such as `"attachment"`, `"revision"` or `"nav_menu_item"`, or any CPT installed by any plugin), their data will be accessed via the `GenericCustomPost` type.

We indicate the CPTs to retrieve via field argument `filter.customPostTypes`, which receives a list of strings, with the CPT names as defined in WordPress (such as `"post"`, `"page"`, etc). For instance:

```graphql
query {
  customPosts(
    filter: { customPostTypes: ["some-custom-cpt"] }
  ) {
    ... on CustomPost {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

This query retrieves entries from multiple CPTS:

```graphql
query {
  customPosts(
    filter: {
      customPostTypes: [
        "post",
        "page",
        "attachment",
        "nav_menu_item",
        "custom_css",
        "revision"
      ],
      status: [
        publish,
        inherit,
        auto_draft
      ]
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    content
    status
    customPostType
    __typename
  }
}
```

Because all Custom Posts implement interface `CustomPost`, we can retrieve data from `CustomPostUnion` using a fragment reference or an inline fragment:

```graphql
query {
  comments {
    id
    date
    content
    customPost {
      __typename
      ...on CustomPost {
        id
        title
        url
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If we know that the comment was added to a post, we can also query fields specific to the `Post`:

```graphql
query {
  comments {
    id
    date
    content
    customPost {
      __typename
      ...on CustomPost {
        id
        title
        url
      }
      ...on Post {
        categoryNames
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Filtering CPTs by a custom taxonomy

A custom post type can have custom taxonomies (tags and categories) associated to them. For instance, a CPT `"product"` may have associated the category taxonomy `"product-cat"` and the tag taxonomy `"product-tag"`.

We can filter results by these associated taxonomies, via inputs `tagTaxonomy` and `categoryTaxonomy` in the `filter` input.

In the query below, we fetch custom posts filtering by category:

```graphql
query {
  customPosts(
    filter: {
      categoryIDs: [26, 28],
      categoryTaxonomy: "product-cat"
    }
  ) {
    ... on CustomPost {
      id
      title
    }
    ... on GenericCustomPost {
      categories(taxonomy: "product-cat") {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Fetching custom CPT data

Using `GenericCustomPost`, we can only request those fields which are common to all CPTs; fetching custom data from some CPT is not supported (such as fetching the price data for a custom CPT `"product"`).

To fetch custom CPT data, instead, we need to create the corresponding resolvers, in PHP code, to map the CPT to the schema:

- Create a type `Product`
- Attach a `price` field to it

Now, the `CustomPostUnion` type (returned by `Root.customPosts`) will resolve all entries from this CPT to a `Product` type.

```graphql
query {
  customPosts(
    filter: {
      customPostTypes: "product"
    }
  ) {
    __typename
    ...on CustomPost { # interface implemented by all CPT types
      id
      title
      customPostType
      status
    }
    ...on Product { # custom CPT type
      price # custom field
    }
  }
}
```

We can additionally create field `Root.products: [Product!]`, and use it directly:

```graphql
query {
  products {
    __typename # Product
    id
    title
    status
    price # custom field
  }
}
```
