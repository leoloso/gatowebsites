In other words, is it possible to tell the GraphQL server to flatten the shape of the response? And, if so, how to do it?

Here is a solution with Gato GraphQL, making use of the following extensions:

- [Multiple Query Execution](/extensions/multiple-query-execution), to `@export` the value of a variable across GraphQL operations
- [PHP Functions via Schema](/extensions/php-functions-via-schema), to print this value again on the desired location via the `_echo` field

With `@export`, we can have a first query operation export some result to a variable, and then declare a second query operation that will read this variable and print it on the expected location in the response:

```graphql
query ExportDate
{
  allMdx {
    edges {
      node {
        frontmatter {
          date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
            @export(as: "date")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

query PrintRelocatedDate($date: String)
  @depends(on: "ExportDate")
{
  allMdx {
    edges {
      node {
        publishedAt: _echo(value: $date)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

...and then executing the query (passing `?operationName=PrintRelocatedDate`) will produce this response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "allMdx": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "frontmatter": {
            "publishedAt": "February 06, 2021"
          },
          "publishedAt": "February 06, 2021"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
