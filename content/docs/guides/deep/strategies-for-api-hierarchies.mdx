We can apply different ideas to set-up a hierarchy for our API endpoints.

## Query first, override schema

We can define the parent to contain a common GraphQL query, and then extend it for each of the different applications.

For instance, the parent persisted query `/graphql-query/posts/` will define the GraphQL query:

```graphql
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    id
    title
    url
  }
}
```

And the child persisted queries, for the website and the mobile app, will set the corresponding schema configuration:

- `/graphql-query/posts/website/` => use schema configuration `"Website"`
- `/graphql-query/posts/mobile-app/` => use schema configuration `"Mobile app"`

## Schema first, override query

Alternatively, we can declare the schema configuration at the parent level, and then all children inherit it, and implement only the GraphQL query:

- `/graphql-query/mobile-app/posts/`
- `/graphql-query/mobile-app/users/`
- `/graphql-query/website/posts/`
- `/graphql-query/website/users/`

## Translate endpoint

Translate the content in an endpoint by providing the language code via a variable, which can be overriden by the child endpoint.

For instance, we can create a persisted query `/graphql-query/posts/` with this GraphQL query:

```graphql
query GetTranslatedPosts($lang: String!) {
  posts {
    title @strTranslate(from: "en", to: $lang)
    url
  }
}
```

We don't need to execute this endpoint directly, so it can be disabled.

Then, we create child persisted query `/graphql-query/posts/french/`, which overrides the GraphQL variable:

```json
{
  "lang": "fr"
}
```
