This is how Gato GraphQL has mapped the WordPress data model into a corresponding GraphQL schema.

## The WordPress data model

WordPress has the following entities:

- posts
- pages
- custom posts
- media elements
- users
- user roles
- tags
- categories
- comments
- blocks
- meta properties
- others (options, plugins, themes, etc)

These entities can have a hierarchy. For instance, post, page and media elements are both custom post types, and tags and categories are both taxonomies.

This is the WordPress database diagram, showing how data for all entities is stored:

![The WordPress database diagram](/assets/guides/downstream/wordpress/wp-data-model.png "The WordPress database diagram")

## Is the mapping an exact replica of the DB diagram?

When mapping the WordPress database into a GraphQL schema, is the same diagrame above respected 1 to 1?

No, it is not. While the database diagram is an actual implementation, GraphQL is an interface to access the data from the client. These two are related, but they can be different. GraphQL doesn't care about the database: it doesn't think in SQL commands, or know there are database tables called `wp_posts` and `wp_users`.

So we don't need to worry too much about the database diagram when creating the GraphQL schema for WordPress. Even more, we can produce a GraphQL schema that fixes some of the technical debt from the WordPress data model.

## Mapping the WordPress data model as a GraphQL schema

Let's do the mapping. First, we map the original entities as types, as much as possible. From the list of entities in the WordPress data model, we produce the following types for the GraphQL schema:

- `Post`
- `Page`
- `Media`
- `User`
- `UserRole`
- `PostTag`
- `PostCategory`
- `Comment`

Then, we add all the expected fields to every type. To represent the schema, we can use the SDL, or Schema Definition Language. (This is used for documentation purposes only; the plugin itself does not use SDL to codify the schema: it's all PHP code).

These are the fields (among many others) for a `Post`:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  content: String
  excerpt: String
  date: Date!
}
```

These are the fields (among many others) for a `User`:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  email: String!
}
```

We also create the corresponding connections, which are fields that return another entity (instead of a scalar, such as a number or a string). For instance, we represent a post having an author, and a user owning posts:

```graphql
type Post {
  author: User!
}

type User {
  posts: [Post]
}
```

Fields and connections can also accept arguments. For instance, we enable `Post.dateStr` to be formatted, and `User.posts` to filter entries, limit their number and sort them:

```graphql
type Post {
  dateStr(format: String): Date!
}

type User {
  posts(
    filter: RootPostsFilterInput
    pagination: PostPaginationInput
    sort: CustomPostSortInput
  ): [Post!]!
}

input RootPostsFilterInput {
  authorIDs: [ID!]
  authorSlug: String
  categoryIDs: [ID!]
  dateQuery: [DateQueryInput!]
  excludeAuthorIDs: [ID!]
  excludeIDs: [ID!]
  hasPassword: Boolean = false
  ids: [ID!]
  isSticky: Boolean
  metaQuery: [CustomPostMetaQueryInput!]
  password: String
  search: String
  status: [FilterCustomPostStatusEnum!]
  tagIDs: [ID!]
  tagSlugs: [String!]
}

input PostPaginationInput {
  limit: Int
  offset: Int
}

input CustomPostSortInput {
  by: CustomPostOrderByEnum
  order: OrderEnum
}

# ...
```

We keep doing this for all entities in the WordPress data model. Once we are done, we'll arrive at the GraphQL schema for WordPress, as visible using the Voyager client (available as "Interactive Schema" on the plugin's menu):

![The GraphQL schema for WordPress](/assets/guides/upstream/interactive-schema.png "The GraphQL schema for WordPress")

This schema has similarities to the WordPress database diagram, but also several differences. Let's analyse them.

### Operations without entity are mapped as Root fields

In the WordPress database diagram represents how data is stored, so there is no "beginning". GraphQL, though, is an interface to retrieve data, hence there must be an initial stage from which to execute the query.

This initial stage is the `Root` type, or, to be more precise, the `QueryRoot` and `MutationRoot` types (to deal with queries and mutations, respectively).

In these two types, we map all operations that do not depend on an entity, such as when executing `get_posts()`, `get_users()` or `wp_signon()`:

```graphql
type QueryRoot {
  posts: [Post]!
  users: [User]!
}

type MutationRoot {
  loginUser(
    usernameOrEmail: String!,
    password: String!
  ): User
}
```

The fields do not need to have the same name or signature as the operation they represent. For instance, calling field `loginUser` can be considered more suitable than `signOn`.

### Grouping schema elements

We can apply enhancements to simplify the schema and make it more useful. For instance, a field can receive all its arguments via an input object, which can be re-used across several fields and makes it easier to visualize the schema:

```graphql
type MutationRoot {
  loginUser(input: LoginUserByInput!): User
}

input LoginUserByInput {
    usernameOrEmail: String!,
    password: String!
}
```

In addition, the response from a mutation can be a "payload" object, which in addition to returning the affected object can also include the status of the operation and error messages:

```graphql
type MutationRoot {
  loginUser(input: LoginUserByInput!): RootLoginUserMutationPayload!
}

type RootLoginUserMutationPayload {
  errors: [RootLoginUserMutationErrorPayloadUnion!]
  status: OperationStatusEnum!
  user: User
  userID: ID
}

union RootLoginUserMutationErrorPayloadUnion = GenericErrorPayload
  | InvalidUserEmailErrorPayload
  | InvalidUsernameErrorPayload
  | PasswordIsIncorrectErrorPayload
  | UserIsLoggedInErrorPayload
```

### All mutations go under MutationRoot

There are operations which do depend on an entity, such as `wp_update_post()`, which is applied on some post. The corresponding mutation on the GraphQL schema must be added to the `MutationRoot` type, because that's how GraphQL works.

Then, this operation is mapped like this:

```graphql
type MutationRoot {
  updatePost(input: RootUpdatePostFilterInput!): PostUpdateMutationPayload!
}

input RootUpdatePostFilterInput {
  categoryIDs: [ID!]
  content: String
  featuredImageID: ID
  id: ID!
  status: CustomPostStatusEnum
  tags: [String!]
  title: String
}
```

This plugin also supports nested mutations, which are offered as an opt-in feature (because this is not standad GraphQL behavior). Then, mutations can also be added under any type, not just `MutationRoot`. In this case, we obtain:

```graphql
type Post {
  update(input: PostUpdateFilterInput!): PostUpdateMutationPayload!
}

input PostUpdateFilterInput {
  categoryIDs: [ID!]
  content: String
  featuredImageID: ID
  status: CustomPostStatusEnum
  tags: [String!]
  title: String
}
```

Please notice the difference between inputs `RootUpdatePostFilterInput` and `PostUpdateFilterInput` (i.e. between mutations from the root, and nested mutations): the former one has the mandatory property `id` as to indicate which post to modify, but the latter one does not, as it doesn't need it.

### Dealing with custom posts

There is no type inheritance in GraphQL. Hence, we can't have a type `CustomPost`, and declare that `Post` and `Page` extend it.

GraphQL offers two resources to compensate for this lack: interfaces and union types.

For the first one, we create an interface `CustomPost` for the schema, declaring all the fields expected from a custom post, and we define types `Post`, `Page` and `GenericCustomPost` (to represent all custom post types defined by any installed theme and plugin) to implement the interface:

```graphql
interface CustomPost {
  title: String
  content: String
  excerpt: String
  date(format: String): Date!
}

type Post implements CustomPost {
  title: String
  content: String
  excerpt: String
  date(format: String): Date!
}

type Page implements CustomPost {
  title: String
  content: String
  excerpt: String
  date(format: String): Date!
}

type GenericCustomPost implements CustomPost {
  title: String
  content: String
  excerpt: String
  date(format: String): Date!
}
```

For the second one, we create a `CustomPostUnion` type for the schema returning all the custom post types:

```graphql
union CustomPostUnion = Post | Page | GenericCustomPost
```

And have fields return this type whenever appropriate:

```graphql
type QueryRoot {
  customPost(id: ID): CustomPostUnion
  customPosts: [CustomPostUnion]!
}

type User {
  customPosts: [CustomPostUnion]
}

type Comment {
  customPost: CustomPostUnion!
}
```

When executing the query, we can either select the fields based on the actual type, such as `Post`, or on the interface `CustomPost`:

```graphql
{  
  customPosts {
    __typename
    ...on CustomPost {
      id
      title
      slug
      status
    }
    ...on Post {
      isSticky
      postFormat
    }
  }
}
```

As it can be observed, in the GraphQL schema we need to explicitly assert when we are dealing with posts, and when with custom posts, since they are not the same! Calling these two interchangeably is technical debt from WordPress, which the plugin attempts to fix whenever possible.

For this reason, a custom post is always called `CustomPost` and not `Post`, a field dealing with custom posts is always called `customPosts` and not `posts`, and a field argument receiving the ID for a custom post is called `customPostID` and not `postID` (even though that's how it's called in the mapped WordPress function).

Then, the expectation is always clear:

- Field `User.customPosts` can return a list of any custom post, including posts and pages, and `User.posts` only returns posts
- Field `Root.setFeaturedImageOnCustomPost` can add a featured image to any custom post, that's why it's not called `setFeaturedImageOnPost`

### Not grouping tags (and categories) under a single type

Why is type `PostTag` (and same for `PostCategory`) called like that, instead of just `Tag`?

Because, when executing this query (where a product is a CPT), the results from field `tags` for posts and products will always be different, non-overlapping:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    tags {
      id
      name
    }
  }
  products {
    tags {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Tags added to posts will not show up when retrieving tags for products, and the other way around (unless a product also uses the `post_tag` taxonomy, but then it can also be represented with the `PostTag` type). This does not represent a big deal in WordPress, since these items can be considered different rows from the same database table. But it does matter for GraphQL, which is strongly typed.

Then, it's a good design decision to keep these entities separate, under their own types, and have tags for posts returned under the `PostTag` type and, if a custom plugin implements its own product CPT, it must use the `ProductTag` type for its tags.

### Giving media items their own identity

Media entities in WordPress are custom post types, only because it was convenient from an implementation point of view. However, the GraphQL schema can avoid this technical debt, and model media elements as a distinct entity, not as custom posts.

This implies the following decisions for the GraphQL schema:

- The `Media` type does not implement the `CustomPost` interface, and won't be part of the `CustomPostUnion` type
- The `Media` type doesn't have many fields expected from a custom post type, such as `excerpt`, `date` and `status`. Instead, it only has those fields expected from a media element:

```graphql
type Media {
  id: ID!
  src: String!
  width: Int
  height: Int
}
```

### Identifying and mapping enums

In some situations, WordPress uses fixed values from a given set. For instance, the status of a post can only be `"publish"`, `"draft"`, `"pending"` or `"trash"`.

In GraphQL, we can treat these as enums (instead of strings), and create a corresponding enumeration type. Following the GraphQL standard, enums should be written in uppercase, like this:

```graphql
enum CUSTOM_POST_STATUS {
  PUBLISH
  DRAFT
  PENDING
  TRASH
}
```

However, then the query can't be directly used to interact with WordPress, since executing `get_posts( [ "post_status" => "PUBLISH" ] )` doesn't work.

So, as a compromise, we keep these enum values in lowercase:

```graphql
enum CUSTOM_POST_STATUS {
  publish
  draft
  pending
  trash
}
```

### Mapping additional types

Blocks are not directly visible in the WordPress database diagram, since they are stored in `wp_posts` (there is no table `wp_blocks`), but nevertheless thay are a distinct entity.

Hence, we can still introduce a `Block` type to map them:

```graphql
type Post {
  blocks: [Block]
}

type Block {
  type: String!
  attributes: JSONObject
}
```
