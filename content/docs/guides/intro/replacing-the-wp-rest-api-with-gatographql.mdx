title: Replacing the WP REST API

If your application is using the WP REST API, it is possible to use Gato GraphQL instead.

With the [Persisted Queries](/extensions/persisted-queries) extension you can publish REST-like endpoints, composed using GraphQL.

For each of the REST endpoints in your application, you can create a corresponding persisted query endpoint that retrieves the same data, and use that endpoint instead.

For instance, the following GraphQL query can replace REST endpoint `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/`:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
    date: dateStr(format: "Y-m-d\\TH:i:s")
    modified: modifiedDateStr(format: "Y-m-d\\TH:i:s")
    slug
    status
    link: url
    title: self {
      rendered: title
    }
    content: self {
      rendered: content
    },
    excerpt: self {
      rendered: excerpt
    }
    author
    featured_media: featuredImage
    sticky: isSticky
    categories
    tags
  }
}
```

Thanks to the [API hierarchy](/guides/use/creating-an-api-hierarchy), the persisted query be published under path `/graphql-query/wp/v2/posts/`, making it easy to map endpoints.

To replicate REST endpoint `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/{id}/`, which retrieves data for the post with given ID, we can provide the post ID under URL param `postId`.

For instance, the following persisted query can be invoked under endpoint `/graphql-query/wp/v2/posts/single/?postId={id}`:

```graphql
query GetPost($postId: ID!) {
  post(by: { id: $postId }) {
    id
    date: dateStr(format: "Y-m-d\\TH:i:s")
    modified: modifiedDateStr(format: "Y-m-d\\TH:i:s")
    slug
    status
    link: url
    title: self {
      rendered: title
    }
    content: self {
      rendered: content
    },
    excerpt: self {
      rendered: excerpt
    }
    author
    featured_media: featuredImage
    sticky: isSticky
    categories
    tags
  }
}
```
