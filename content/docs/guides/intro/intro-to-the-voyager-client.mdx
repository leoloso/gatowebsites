Gato GraphQL provides the GraphQL Voyager client to visualize the GraphQL schema interactively. Access it by clicking on "Interactive Schema" on the plugin's menu:

Voyager provides a birds-eye view of the GraphQL schema:

It makes it simple to understand how all elements in the schema relate to each other, using arrows to show the connections between types:

![Schema-elements](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/voyager-schema-elements.png "Schema-elements")

The schema has a starting point, i.e. a type from which all relationships are calculated. By default, this is the query root (in this case, handled via the `QueryRoot` type), which is indicated in the floating panel at the bottom. To visualize the schema concerning mutations, we can select the corresponding mutation root type (in this case, `MutationRoot`):

![Switched to view from the mutation root](/assets/guides/downstream/clients/voyager-mutations-schema.png "Switched to view from the mutation root")

Clicking on a type on the schema will highlight its connections, and display the metadata for its fields (the same outcome happens when clicking on the type's name on the left-side panel):

The search input on the left-side panel enables to filter the schema elements:

Clicking on a connection will highlight it, both in the schema and on the left-side panel:

We can use the mouse (and, to some extent, the buttons on the bottom-right of the screen) to navigate the graph, zooming in and out, moving in any direction, and focusing on elements:

On the floating panel on the bottom, we have a few additional options:

- "Sort by alphabet" alphabetically sorts all fields in each type
- "Skip Relay" removes [Relay](https://relay.dev/)'s wrapper classes
- "Skip deprecated" hides all deprecated fields
- "Show leaf fields" displays all fields which are not a connection
