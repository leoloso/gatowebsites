ðŸ“£ **Note:** This feature is unlocked by the [PHP Functions via Schema](/extensions/php-functions-via-schema/) extension.

The GraphQL schema is provided with fields which expose functionalities commonly found in programming languages (such as PHP).

Function fields are **Global Fields**, hence they are added to every single type in the GraphQL schema: in `QueryRoot`, but also in `Post`, `User`, etc.

Function fields are useful for manipulating the data once it has been retrieved, allowing us to transform a field value in whatever way it is required, and granting us powerful data import/export capabilities.

For instance, while we have a `Post.hasComments` fields, we may need the opposite value. Instead of creating a new field `Post.notHasComments` (for which we'd need to edit PHP code), we can use the **Field to Input** feature to input the value from `hasComments` into a `not` field, thus calculating the new value always within the GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    id
    hasComments
    notHasComments: _not(value: $__hasComments)
  }
}
```
