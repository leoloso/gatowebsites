Here are examples of the two supported operations in the GraphQL server: queries and mutations.

## Queries

Use the `query` operation to retrieve data (similar to a `GET` operation in REST).

```graphql
query {
  post(by: { id: 1 }) {
    title
  }
}
```

## Mutations

Use the `mutation` operation to create, update or delete data (similar to a `POST`, `PUT` or `DELETE` operations in REST).

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(
    input: {
      title: "Hi there!"
      contentAs: { html: "How do you like it?" }
      status: draft
      tags: ["demo", "plugin"]
    }
  ) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
    postID
  }
}
```
