Gato GraphQL will cache its internal configuration, and the [calculated GraphQL schema](../caching-the-graphql-schema), to improve performance.

The cache works by storing files to disk, under folder `wp-content/plugins/graphql-api/cache`.

We can define a new location for the cache folder, such as when:

- We have removed writing permissions from under `wp-content/plugins`
- We rather place it under a different location, such as `wp-content/uploads`

## Defining the new folder

Indicate the full path to the new cache folder, via either (in order of priority):

1. An environment variable `CACHE_DIR`
2. Defining constant `GATOGRAPHQL_CACHE_DIR` in `wp-config.php`:

```php
// File wp-config.php
define( 'GATOGRAPHQL_CACHE_DIR', '/path/to/cache' );
```
