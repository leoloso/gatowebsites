Grant non-admin users access to create and manage endpoints.

{/* <!-- Following the same <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#summary-of-roles" target="_blank">scheme as when editing posts in WordPress</a>, where users with different roles (`subscriber`, `contributor`, `author` and `editor`) have access to different capabilities:

| Role | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Editor | Can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users |
| Author | Can publish and manage their own posts |
| Contributor | Can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them |
| Subscriber | Can only read posts | --> */}

Decide which users can access the GraphiQL and Interactive schema clients in the admin, and are able to edit the GraphQL schema, by selecting the appropriate configuration from the dropdown in the "Plugin Configuration > Schema Editing Access" tab on the Settings page:

- `Users with capability: "gatographql_manage_graphql_schema"`
- `Users with role: "administrator"`
- `Users with any role: "administrator", "editor"`
- `Users with any role: "administrator", "editor", "author"`

The first option (`Users with capability: "gatographql_manage_graphql_schema"`) is selected by default, granting access to users with the `administrator` role only.
