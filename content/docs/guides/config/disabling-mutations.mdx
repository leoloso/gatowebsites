There are two ways to disable mutations in the GraphQL schema, depending if it must be done for all endpoints or just for some specific one(s).

## 1. Disabling mutations for all endpoints

_(This can be done in the standard plugin, no need for extensions.)_

Go to the Modules page, and disable the **Mutations** module (as shown in guide [Browsing, enabling and disabling modules](/guides/config/browsing-enabling-and-disabling-modules)). This will then prevent all mutations from all other modules from being registered in first place.

## 2. Disabling mutations for some specific endpoint

This is accomplished via [Access Control](/guides/use/defining-access-control), by removing access to the mutation operation. For that, create an Access Control entry containing:

- The private visibility mode
- The "Disable access" rule
- The `"mutation"` operation
