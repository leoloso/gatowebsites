The GraphQL single endpoint allows to execute queries against the GraphQL server with unrestrained access. Enabled by default, [it can be disabled by disabling the "Single Endpoint" module](/guides/config/browsing-enabling-and-disabling-modules).

The single endpoint path is `/graphql/` by default. This value can be modified through the Settings, on tab "Single Endpoint":

The GraphQL single endpoint can be configured by assigning a Schema Configuration to it. To do this, on section "Schema Configuration" select the desired entry from the dropdown for "Schema Configuration for the Single Endpoint":
