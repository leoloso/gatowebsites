The Tutorial section explains how to achieve many objectives, exploring all the elements from the GraphQL schema.

By taking the tutorial, you will learn about all the distinctive features of Gato GraphQL.

The tutorial is disabled by default, and you need to enable it on the Settings.

## Settings to enable the Schema Tutorial page

An option to enable the Tutorial section is on the Settings page, under "Plugin Configuration > General > Enable Schema Tutorial?":

<Image
  src="/assets/guides/upstream/settings-hide-tutorial-page.png"
  width="1024"
  height="940"
  alt="Enabling the Schema tutorial page in the Settings"
  caption="Enabling the Schema tutorial page in the Settings"
/>

Alternatively, we can define this value in `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'GATOGRAPHQL_ENABLE_SCHEMA_TUTORIAL', true );
```
