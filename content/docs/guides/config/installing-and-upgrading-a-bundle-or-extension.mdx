Make sure that you have the Gato GraphQL plugin installed and active.

After purchasing a [bundle or extension](/extensions), you will have access to the corresponding plugin file. Download it and install it in your WordPress site (under `Plugins > Add new > Upload`), and activate it.

Upon activation, an admin notice will request to provide the license key:

<div class="img-width-1024" markdown="1">

![Admin notice requesting to provide the license key](/assets/shop/install-product-admin-notice.png "Admin notice requesting to provide the license key")

</div>

Click on the link to go to the Settings page. Then copy/paste the license key, and click on `Activate Licenses (or Deactivate/Validate)`.

<div class="img-width-1024" markdown="1">

![Entering the license key](/assets/shop/install-product-enter-license-key.png "Entering the license key")

</div>

The bundle or extension will now be activated:

<div class="img-width-1024" markdown="1">

![Plugin activated](/assets/shop/install-product-activated.png "Plugin activated")

</div>

## Upgrading a bundle or extension (when a new version is released)

While your purchased product's license is active, the download file (available via [My Orders](/shop/my-orders)) will be the most up-to-date one.

Whenever the Gato GraphQL plugin releases a new version, bundles and extensions may also release a new, corresponding upgrade, with the same version number. Check if there is such an update and, if so, download it and install it on your WordPress site.
