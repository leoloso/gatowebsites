We can configure mutation fields to return [either of these 2 different entities](/features/mutation-return-type):

- A payload object type
- Directly the mutated entity

When returning using the payload object type, we can additionally [add fields to the schema to query the mutation payload objects](/guides/interact/handling-mutation-payloads#query-the-mutation-payload-objects).

Overall, we can configure the GraphQL schema with one among three options:

- Use payload types for mutations
- Use payload types for mutations, and add fields to query those payload objects
- Do not use payload types for mutations (i.e. return the mutated entity)

Using payload object types for mutations in the schema can be configured as follows, in order of priority:

✅ Specific mode for the custom endpoint or persisted query, defined in the schema configuration

![Defining if and how to use payload object types for mutations, set in the Schema configuration](/assets/guides/upstream/schema-configuration-payload-object-types-for-mutations.png "Defining if and how to use payload object types for mutations, set in the Schema configuration")

✅ Default mode, defined in the Settings

If the schema configuration has value `"Default"`, it will use the mode defined in the Settings:
