We can configure mutation fields to return [either of these 2 different entities](/features/mutation-return-type):

- A payload object type
- Directly the mutated entity

Using payload object types for mutations in the schema can be configured as follows, in order of priority:

✅ Specific mode for the custom endpoint or persisted query, defined in the schema configuration

![Defining if to use payload object types for mutations, set in the Schema configuration](/assets/guides/upstream/schema-configuration-payload-object-types-for-mutations.png "Defining if to use payload object types for mutations, set in the Schema configuration")

✅ Default mode, defined in the Settings

If the schema configuration has value `"Default"`, it will use the mode defined in the Settings:
