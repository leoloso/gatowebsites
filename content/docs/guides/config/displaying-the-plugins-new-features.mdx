Immediately after updating the plugin, an admin notice will display a link to read the release notes for the new version:

When clicking on the link, the release notes are shown on a modal window:

To disable this behavior, uncheck option `Display admin notice with release notes?` on the "Plugin Configuration > General" tab from the Settings:
