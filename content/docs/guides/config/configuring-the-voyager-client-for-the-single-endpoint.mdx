When module "Single Endpoint" is enabled, if module "Interactive Schema for Single Endpoint" is enabled, then the single endpoint's Voyager client becomes publicly available.

![Single endpoint's Interactive Schema client](/assets/guides/upstream/single-endpoint-interactive-schema.png "Single endpoint's Interactive Schema client")

To open it, click on link "ðŸŸ¢ Interactive Schema (public client for the single endpoint)" on the plugin's menu:

  caption=Single endpoint's link to the Voyager client
/> */}

By default, the client is exposed under `/schema/`. This path can be modified on the Settings, under tab "Interactive Schema for Single Endpoint":
