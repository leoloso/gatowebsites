Immediately after updating the plugin, an admin notice will display a link to read the release notes for the new version:

<a href="/assets/guides/downstream/admin-notice-release-notes.png" target="_blank">![Offering to read the release notes via an admin notice](/assets/guides/downstream/admin-notice-release-notes.png "Offering to read the release notes via an admin notice")</a>

When clicking on the link, the release notes are shown on a modal window:

<a href="/assets/guides/downstream/release-notes-in-modal.png" target="_blank">![Release notes in a modal window](/assets/guides/downstream/release-notes-in-modal.png "Release notes in a modal window")</a>

To disable this behavior, uncheck option `Display admin notice with release notes?` on the "Plugin Configuration > General" tab from the Settings:
