The tutorial is disabled by default, and you need to enable it on the Settings.

## Settings to enable the Schema Tutorial page

An option to enable the Tutorial section is on the Settings page, under "Plugin Configuration > General > Enable Schema Tutorial?":

<Image
  src="/assets/guides/upstream/settings-enable-schema-tutorial-page.png"
  width="1024"
  height="820"
  alt="Enabling the Schema tutorial page in the Settings"
  caption="Enabling the Schema tutorial page in the Settings"
/>

Alternatively, we can define this value in `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'GATOGRAPHQL_ENABLE_SCHEMA_TUTORIAL_PAGE', true );
```
