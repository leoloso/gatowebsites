The are several fields which return a list of results, and we can limit how many results to fetch by providing the `limit` field argument in the query.

In the Settings page, we can configure the default limit value to use (for when it's not provided in the query), and the max number it can be.

## Custom Posts

In tab "Custom Posts" we can configure custom posts:

{/* <Image
  src=/assets/guides/upstream/settings-customposts-limits.png
  width="1024"
  height="940"
  alt=Settings for Custom Post limits
  caption=Settings for Custom Post limits
/> */}
