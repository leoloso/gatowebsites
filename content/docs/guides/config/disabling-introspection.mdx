The introspection `__schema` field is exposed in the [Access Control Lists](../../use/defining-access-control):

![__schema field in the Access Control List](/assets/guides/downstream-pro/schema-introspection-field-in-acl.png "__schema field in the Access Control List")

This allows us to disable introspection for the [single endpoint](../../config/enabling-and-configuring-the-single-endpoint) or [custom endpoints](../../use/creating-a-custom-endpoint/), following any of the already available rules, such as:

- Disable always
- Disable for logged-out users
- Disable for users without a certain role or capability

For instance, opening the GraphiQL client on a custom endpoint after disabling access to `__schema` we get an error:

> Uncaught (in promise) Error: Invalid or incomplete introspection result. Ensure that you are passing "data" property of introspection response and no "errors" was returned alongside: \{ __schema: null \}
