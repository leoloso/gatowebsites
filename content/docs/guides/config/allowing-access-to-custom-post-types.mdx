The custom post types that can be queried must be explicitly configured. This can be done in 2 places.

In the Schema Configuration applied to the endpoint, by selecting option `"Use custom configuration"` under "Customize configuration, or use default from Settings?" and then selecting the desired items:

![Selecting the allowed Custom Post Types in the Schema Configuration](/assets/guides/upstream/customposts-schema-configuration-queryable-cpts.png "Selecting the allowed Custom Post Types in the Schema Configuration")

Or, if selecting option `"Use configuration from Settings"`, the value defined under section "Included custom post types" in the Settings page for `Schema Custom Posts` is used:

{/* <Image

  height="940"
  alt=Selecting the allowed Custom Post Types in the Settings
  caption=Selecting the allowed Custom Post Types in the Settings
/> */}
