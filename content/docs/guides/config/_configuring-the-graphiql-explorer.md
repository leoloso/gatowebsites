We can customize in the Settings, under tab "GraphiQL Explorer", which GraphiQL clients will have the Explorer enabled, from the following locations:

- GraphiQL client in the admin area
- When creating persisted queries in the admin area
- In the single endpoint's public GraphiQL client
- In the custom endpoints' public GraphiQL client
