With the [PHP Constants and Environment Variables via Schema](/extensions/php-constants-and-environment-variables-via-schema/) extension, the GraphQL schema is provided with global field `_env`, which allows to obtain a value from an environment variable, or from a PHP constant.

We must configure the list of allowed environment variables and constants that can be queried.

{/* <!-- By default, this list is initially empty. (Unless the unsafe default settings to [build static sites](../building-static-sites) are enabled, in which case any name is allowed by default.) --> */}

Each entry can either be:

- A regex (regular expression), if it's surrounded by `/` or `#`, or
- The full variable or constant name, otherwise

For instance, any of these entries match environment variable `"GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN"`:

- `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `#^([A-Z]*)_ACCESS_TOKEN$#`
- `/GITHUB_(\S+)/`

There are 2 places where this configuration can take place, in order of priority:

1. Custom: In the corresponding Schema Configuration
2. General: In the Settings page

In the Schema Configuration applied to the endpoint, select option `"Use custom configuration"` and then input the desired entries:

![Defining the entries on the Schema Configuration](/assets/guides/upstream-pro/environment-fields-schema-configuration-entries.png "Defining the entries on the Schema Configuration")

Otherwise, the entries defined in the "Environment Fields" tab from the Settings will be used:

There are 2 behaviors, "Allow access" and "Deny access":

- **Allow access:** only the configured entries can be accessed, and no other can<br/>
- **Deny access:** the configured entries cannot be accessed, all other entries can
