Within [Access Control](/guides/use/defining-access-control), we can validate that the user has access to the selected schema elements (operations, fields and directives) using the standard WordPress access control functionality:

- Is the user logged-in or not? (Via rule **User State**)
- Does the user have the required role(s)? (Via rule **User Roles**)
- Does the user have the required capability(ies)? (Via rule **User Capabilities**)
