Custom endpoints and persisted queries can be organized into a hierarchy. This is achieved when they declare a parent, in which case their endpoint paths will extend the parent's endpoint path.

For instance, we can create this hierarchy:

- Parent persisted query: `/graphql-query/posts/`
- Child persisted query: `/graphql-query/posts/english/`
- Child persisted query: `/graphql-query/posts/french/`

The number of levels is unlimited, so we can also create:

- `/graphql-query/posts/`
- `/graphql-query/posts/mobile-app/`
- `/graphql-query/posts/mobile-app/english/`
- `/graphql-query/posts/mobile-app/french/`
- `/graphql-query/posts/website/`
- `/graphql-query/posts/website/english/`
- `/graphql-query/posts/website/french/`

## Property inheritance

Child custom endpoints and persisted queries will inherit properties from the parent.

### Custom endpoints and persisted queries

Child custom endpoints and persisted queries will inherit the parent's schema configuration.

### Persisted queries only

Child persisted queries will also inherit the parent's GraphQL query and variables. Values for variables can be overriden by the child, on a variable-by-variable basis.

For instance, if the parent declares these variables:

```json
{
  "limit": 5,
  "offset": 0
}
```

And the child declares these variables:

```json
{
  "limit": 10
}
```

Then, the computed variables for the child will be:

```json
{
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0
}
```

## Creating an API hierarchy

In the custom endpoint or persisted query, in the Document settings, there is section `Page Attributes` with a dropdown of all other entities, to select as the parent:

### Persisted queries

When selecting a parent, in the persisted query will offer a new option, "Inherit query from ancestor(s)?"

Set this option as `Yes`, to have the child persisted query inherit the parent's GraphQL query:

### Example

This persisted query defines its GraphQL query, and declares variable `$limit` with value `1`:

![Parent persisted query](/assets/guides/upstream/parent-persisted-query.png "Parent persisted query")

A child persisted query extends it, inheriting the GraphQL query, and overriding the value for variable `$limit` to `2`:
