When queries are executed against the GraphQL server using `GET` (instead of the more traditional `POST` method), the GraphQL response can be cached on the client-side or intermediate stages between the client and the server (such as a CDN), by relying on standard HTTP caching.

This works naturally for persisted queries, and for the single endpoint and custom endpoints it can work by appending param `?query={ GraphQL query }` to the endpoint.

The configuration is created through a cache control list, and delivered to the endpoint via the schema configuration.

## Executing the endpoint via `GET`

Persisted queries are already suitable to be executed via `GET`, as they store the GraphQL query in the server (i.e. it must not be provided in the body of the request).

For the single endpoint and custom endpoints, though, the query must be provided under param `?query=...` attached to the endpoint URL.

For instance, the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
    title
    url
    author {
      id
      name
      url
    }
  }
}
```

...can be executed via `GET` against the single endpoint like this:

`https://mysite.com/graphql/?query={ posts { id title url author { id name url } } }`

## Automatic max age calculation

The response's `max-age` value is automatically calculated from the access control lists assigned to the endpoint (via the schema configuration).

This value is the lowest `max-age` value from all the fields and directives in the requested query, or `no-store` if either:

- any mutation is executed
- any field or directive has `max-age` with value `0`
- an access control rule must check the user state for any field or directive (in which case, the response is specific to the user, so it cannot be cached)

### Default max-age

Fields which are not given any specific `max-age` will use the default value, defined in the Schema Configuration:

![Default max-age value in the Schema Configuration](/assets/guides/upstream-pro/schema-config-cache-control-default-max-age.png "Default max-age value in the Schema Configuration")

If not set, the default `max-age` value defined in the Settings page, under the "Cache Control" tab, will be used. This value, which is `86400` seconds, can be [modified in the Settings](../../config/setting-the-default-cache-control-max-age/).

### Example

Let's say we have the following configuration of `max-age` values for fields of type `User`:

- `name` => `600`
- `url` => `30`

Then, the response to this query will have the `max-age` value set to `86400` (because neither `displayName` or `email` have been configured, so they use the default value):

```graphql
query {
  users {
    displayName
    email
  }
}
```

The response to this query will have the `max-age` value set to `30` (corresponding to `url`, which is the lowest value from all configured fields):

```graphql
query {
  user(by: {id: 1}) {
    name
    url
  }
}
```

The response to this query will have the `max-age` value set to `no-store` (because field `me` requires user state):

```graphql
query {
  me {
    name
    url
  }
}
```

The response to this query will have the `max-age` value set to `no-store` (because it executes a mutation):

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost {
    id
  }
}
```

## Accessing all cache control lists

Clicking on "Cache Control Lists" on the plugin's menu, it displays the list of all the created cache control lists:

  width="1024"
  height="940"
  alt="Cache Control Lists in the admin"
  caption="Cache Control Lists in the admin"
/>

## Creating a new cache control list

Click on button "Add New Cache Control List" to open the WordPress editor:

![Creating a Cache Control List](/assets/guides/upstream-pro/cache-control-list.png "Creating a Cache Control List")

Give the cache control list a title, add entries with fields and directives, and configure the `max-age` value for them:

![Creating a Cache Control List](/assets/guides/upstream-pro/cache-control.gif "Creating a Cache Control List")

When ready, click on the `Publish` button. Then, the new cache control list becomes available to the schema configuration.

### Cache Control entries

Every Cache Control List contains one or many entries, each of them with the following elements:

- The fields to configure caching for
- The directives to configure caching for
- The `max-age` value for them

#### Selecting fields from interfaces

In addition to fields from types, we can also select fields from interfaces. In this case, the `max-age` value is applied when querying those fields from any type implementing the interface.

### Describing the cache control list

Use the "Excerpt" field, from the Document settings panel, to give a description to the cache control list.

Find more information in guide [Adding a description to the API](../../config/adding-a-description-to-the-api/).

## Using the cache control list

After creating the cache control list, we can have the Custom Endpoint or Persisted Query use it by [editing the corresponding Schema Configuration](../creating-a-schema-configuration/), and selecting the ACL from the list under block "Cache Control Lists".

![Selecting a Cache Control List in the Schema Configuration](/assets/guides/upstream-pro/schema-config-cache-control-lists.png "Selecting a Cache Control List in the Schema Configuration")

If not customizing the configuration, the default Cache Control Lists defined on the Settings page, under tab "Cache Control", will be used:
