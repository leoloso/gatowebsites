A schema configuration is used to customize the schema for Custom Endpoints and Persisted Queries.

The GraphQL schema can be configured with those elements provided by the different installed and enabled modules. (Go to the [Modules page](../../config/browsing-enabling-and-disabling-modules/) to see the list of all of them.)

Each module can define its configuration through its own block in the Schema Configuration editor. This includes blocks for:

- Setting the schema as public or private
- Enabling “sensitive” data elements
- Namespacing the schema
- Using nested mutations
- Defining response headers
- Define [who can access the schema via Access Control Lists](../defining-access-control/)
- Set-up [HTTP caching via Cache Control Lists](../adding-http-caching/)
- Many others

## Accessing all schema configurations

Clicking on "Schema Configurations" on the plugin's menu, it displays the list of all of them:

</div>

## Creating a new schema configuration

Click on button "Add New Schema Configuration" to open the WordPress editor:

<div class="img-width-1024" markdown="1">

</div>

## Removing blocks using "Default" value configurations (optional)

We can remove those configuration blocks which use the corresponding "Default" value from the Settings.

The removed block can be added once again via the inserter menu, by clicking on the `+` button at the bottom (please notice that only one instance of each block can be inserted):

![Removing and adding blocks in the Schema Configuration](/assets/guides/upstream/schema-configuration-removing-and-adding-blocks.gif "Removing and adding blocks in the Schema Configuration")

And then provide the configuration for the required blocks.

### Describing the schema configuration

Use the "Excerpt" field, from the Document settings panel, to give a description to the schema configuration.

Find more information in guide [Adding a description to the API](../../config/adding-a-description-to-the-api/).

## Publishing the schema configuration

Select the required elements for the schema configuration, and adjust the options. When ready, click on "Publish":

## Using the schema configuration

Once published, the schema configuration becomes available to the editors for Custom Endpoints and Persisted Queries:

## Viewing the schema configuration

Opening the schema configuration's permalink in the browser will show its contents (as long as the user is logged-in and the user role has access to it):

## Editor Inputs

These are the inputs in the body of the editor:

| Input | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| **Access Control Lists** | (If module `Access Control` is enabled) Manage who can access the schema, by selecting the Access Control Lists that must be applied to the custom endpoint or persisted query |
| **Cache Control Lists** | (If module `Cache Control` is enabled) Manage the behavior of HTTP caching, by selecting the Cache Control Lists that must be applied to the custom endpoint or persisted query |
| **Further Options** | Customize the behavior of the schema configuration:<br/><br/>**Public/Private Schema:** (If module `Public/Private Schema` is enabled)<br/>When access to some a field or directive is denied, there are 2 ways for the API to behave:<ul><li>`"Public"`: Provide an error message to the user, indicating why access is denied. This behavior makes the metadata from the schema always available.</li><li>`"Private"`: The error message indicates that the field or directive does not exist. This behavior exposes the metadata from the schema only to those users who can access it.</li></ul>If `"Default"` is selected, the value selected in the Settings is used.<br/><br/>**Namespace Types and Interfaces?:** (If module `Schema Namespacing` is enabled)<br/>Define if to have all types and interfaces in the schema automatically namespaced. If `"Default"` is selected, the value selected in the Settings is used.<br/><br/>**Mutation Scheme:** (If module `Nested Mutations` is enabled)<br/>Define if to enable mutations, and if the redundant fields from the root must be removed. If `"Default"` is selected, the value selected in the Settings is used.<br/><br/>**Enable admin fields:** (If module `Schema Expose Admin Data` is enabled)<br/>Define if to add the “sensitive” data elements to the schema. If `"Default"` is selected, the value selected in the Settings is used.<br/><br/>**Enable self fields:** (If module `Schema Self Fields` is enabled)<br/>Define if to add the `self` fields to the schema. If `"Default"` is selected, the value selected in the Settings is used. |

These are the inputs in the Document settings:

| Input | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| **Excerpt** | Provide a description for the schema configuration.<br/>This input is available when module `Excerpt as Description` is enabled | -->
