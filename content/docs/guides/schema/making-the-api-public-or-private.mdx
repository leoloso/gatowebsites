This functionality enhances [access control](/guides/use/defining-access-control), to provide visibility to the schema.

When access to some a field or directive is denied through access control, there are 2 ways for the API to behave:

**Public mode**: the fields in the schema are exposed, and when the permission is not satisfied, the user gets an error message with a description of why the permission was rejected. This behavior makes the metadata from the schema always available.

**Private mode**: the schema is customized to every user, containing only the fields available to him or her, and so when attempting to access a forbidden field, the error message says that the field doesn't exist. This behavior exposes the metadata from the schema only to those users who can access it.

## How to define the visibility for the API

There are 3 levels in which we can define the visibility of the API, if public or private. In order of priority:

### 1. Individually on fields and directives

<Banner type="important">

This option is available when [option "Enable granular control?" in the settings](/guides/config/enabling-granular-public-or-private-mode) is `on`.

</Banner>

We can define the visibility for a set of fields and directives, when editing the entry from the access control list:

![Individual Public/Private schema mode](/assets/guides/upstream-pro/acl-public-private-schema-mode.png "Individual Public/Private schema mode")

### 2. On the schema configuration

We can define the visibility on the schema configuration, to be applied on the custom endpoint or persisted query as a whole:

  width="1024"
  height="940"
  alt="Public/Private schema mode, set in the Schema configuration"
  caption="Public/Private schema mode, set in the Schema configuration"
/>

### 3. Default mode, defined in the Settings

If the schema configuration has value `"Default"`, it will use the mode defined in the Settings:

<Image
  src="/assets/guides/upstream-pro/default-public-private-schema-mode.png"
  width="1024"
  height="940"
  alt="Defaul Public/Private schema mode"
  caption="Defaul Public/Private schema mode"
/>
