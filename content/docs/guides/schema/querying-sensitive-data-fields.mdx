The GraphQL schema must strike a balance between public and private fields, as to avoid exposing private information in a public API.

By default, all fields in the GraphQL schema can only access public data. For instance, `posts` can only retrieve posts with status `"publish"`.

In addition, we can add “sensitive” data fields and input fields to the schema, expected to be used by the admin only, enabled for a specific custom endpoint or persisted query, which can also fetch private data.

For instance, field argument `posts(filter:)` will contain an additional input field `status`, which allows us to retrieve non-published posts (eg: posts with status `"pending"`, `"draft"` or `"trash"`) for any user. Likewise, the schema will expose field `Post.status`, to visualize this piece of data.

## List of “sensitive” data elements

The elements below (among others) are, by default, treated as private data:

**User:**

- `email`
- `roles`
- `capabilities`

**Custom Posts:**

- `status`
- `wpAdminEditURL`
- `hasPassword`
- `password`
- `rawContent`
- `rawTitle`
- `rawExcerpt`

**Comments:**

- `status`
- `rawContent`

**Custom Post Mutations:**

- `authorBy` input

**Menu Items:**

- `rawTitle`

## Overriding the default configuration

The elements listed above can be made public.

In the Settings page, in the corresponding tab for each, there is a checkbox to configure if to treat them as “sensitive” or “normal”:

{/* <Image
  src=/assets/guides/upstream/settings-treat-user-email-as-sensitive-data.png
  width="1024"
  height="940"
  alt=Settings to treat user email as “sensitive” data
  caption=Settings to treat user email as “sensitive” data
/> */}

## Inspecting the “sensitive” data elements via schema introspection

The `isSensitiveDataElement` property is added to field `extensions` when doing schema introspection. To find out which are the “sensitive” data elements from the schema, execute this query:

```graphql
query ViewSensitiveDataElements {
  __schema {
    types {
      name
      fields {
        name
        extensions {
          isSensitiveDataElement
        }
        args {
          name
          extensions {
            isSensitiveDataElement
          }
        }
      }
      inputFields {
        name
        extensions {
          isSensitiveDataElement
        }
      }
      enumValues {
        name
        extensions {
          isSensitiveDataElement
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And then search for entries with `"isSensitiveDataElement": true` in the results.

## Adding “sensitive” data elements to the endpoints

Adding “sensitive” data elements to the schema can be configured as follows, in order of priority:

✅ Specific mode for the custom endpoint or persisted query, defined in the schema configuration

![Adding “sensitive” data elements to the schema, set in the Schema configuration](/assets/guides/upstream/schema-configuration-adding-sensitive-fields-to-schema.png "Adding “sensitive” data elements to the schema, set in the Schema configuration")

✅ Default mode, defined in the Settings

If the schema configuration has value `"Default"`, it will use the mode defined in the Settings:

{/* <Image
  src=/assets/guides/upstream/settings-schema-expose-sensitive-data-default.png
  width="1024"
  height="940"
  alt=Setting “sensitive” data elements for the schema configuration, in the Settings
  caption=Setting “sensitive” data elements for the schema configuration, in the Settings
/> */}

## When to use

Use whenever exposing private information is allowed, such as when building a static website, fetching data from a local WordPress instance (i.e. not a public API).
