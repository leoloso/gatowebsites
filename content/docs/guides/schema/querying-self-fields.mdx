Sometimes we need to modify the shape of the response, to emulate the same response from another GraphQL server, or from the REST API.

We can do this via the `self` field, added to all types in the GraphQL schema, which echoes back the same object where it is applied:

```graphql
type QueryRoot {
  self: QueryRoot!
}

type Post {
  self: Post!
}

type User {
  self: User!
}
```

## How it works

The `self` field allows to append extra levels to the query without leaving the queried object. Running this query:

```graphql
{
  __typename
  self {
    __typename
  }
  
  post(by: {id: 1}) {
    self {
      id
      __typename
    }
  }
  
  user(by: {id: 1}) {
    self {
      id
      __typename
    }
  }
}
```

...produces this response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "__typename": "QueryRoot",
    "self": {
      "__typename": "QueryRoot"
    },
    "post": {
      "self": {
        "id": 1,
        "__typename": "Post"
      }
    },
    "user": {
      "self": {
        "id": 1,
        "__typename": "User"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## How to use

Use `self` to artificially append the extra levels needed for the response, and field aliases to rename those levels appropriately.

For instance, this query recreates the shape of another GraphQL server:

```graphql
{
  categories: self {
    edges: postCategories {
      node: self {
        name
        slug
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query recreates the shape of the WP REST API:

```graphql
{
  post(by: {id: 1}) {
    content: self {
      rendered: content
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding `self` fields to the endpoints

Adding `self` fields to the schema can be configured as follows, in order of priority:

✅ Specific mode for the custom endpoint or persisted query, defined in the schema configuration

![Adding self fields to the schema, set in the Schema configuration](/assets/guides/upstream/schema-configuration-adding-self-fields-to-schema.png "Adding self fields to the schema, set in the Schema configuration")

✅ Default mode, defined in the Settings

If the schema configuration has value `"Default"`, it will use the mode defined in the Settings:

/>

## When to use

The `self` field can be used to adapt the shape of the GraphQL response to some particular required shape, such as the one from another GraphQL server, or from the REST API.
