Have all types and interfaces added to the schema by plugins be automatically namespaced.

Namespacing the schema avoids naming conflicts, which happens when different owners (eg: different teams in the company, or among 3rd party plugins) use the same name for a type or interface.

For instance, let's say that company "AwesomeWP" has the Tutorials and the Sales team, and both of them create a `Product` type for the company's GraphQL schema, producing a conflict.

By namespacing the schema, the two types would be automatically converted to `AwesomeWPTutorialsProduct` and `AwesomeWPSalesProduct`, avoiding the conflict without having to manually modify the schema, or have the teams interact with each other.

## The entities from the WordPress data model are not namespaced

The WordPress data model is considered canonical, and its GraphQL schema types (such as `Post` and `User`) and interfaces (such as `Commentable` and `WithMeta`) are not namespaced.

## Namespacing the schema in the endpoints

There are 2 levels in which we can define if the schema will be namespaced or not. In order of priority:

### 1. On the schema configuration

Namespacing the schema for a custom endpoint or persisted query, can be defined through the corresponding schema configuration:

![Namespacing, set in the Schema configuration](/assets/guides/upstream/schema-configuration-namespacing.png "Namespacing, set in the Schema configuration")

### 2. Default mode, defined in the Settings

If the schema configuration has value `"Default"`, it will use the mode defined in the Settings:

{/* <Image
  src=/assets/guides/upstream/settings-namespacing-default.png
  width="1024"
  height="940"
  alt=Namespacing in Settings
  caption=Namespacing in Settings
/> */}

## Visualizing the namespaced schema

Use the [Voyager client](/guides/intro/intro-to-the-voyager-client) to visualize the namespaced schema.

When namespacing is disabled, the WordPress schema looks like this:

![Interactive schema](/assets/guides/upstream/normal-interactive-schema.png "Interactive schema")

When it is enabled, the types and interfaces added by plugins are namespaced, looking like this:

![Namespaced interactive schema](/assets/guides/upstream/namespaced-interactive-schema.png "Namespaced interactive schema")

## Querying (non-)namespaced type names

Once namespaced is enabled, types can be queried using both their namespaced and non-namespaced type names. Hence, only queries involving conflicting types need be edited, and not all of them.

For instance, if AwesomeWP's Sales team also has a `Discount` type, a query asking for this type name still works:

```graphql
query {
  discounts {
    ...DiscountProps
  }
}

fragment DiscountProps on Discount {
  price
  dateRange
}
```

Only the conflicting type `Product` should be updated to `AwesomeWPSalesProduct` in the query, as to remove any ambiguity:

```graphql
query {
  products {
    ...ProductProps
  }
}

fragment ProductProps on AwesomeWPSalesProduct {
  price
  dateRange
}
```

## GraphQL spec
