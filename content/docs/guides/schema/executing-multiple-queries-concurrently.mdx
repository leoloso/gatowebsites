Multiple queries can be combined together, and executed as a single operation, reusing their state and their data.

<Banner type='info'>

This is different from query batching, in which the GraphQL server also executes multiple queries in a single request, but those queries are merely executed one after the other, independently from each other.

</Banner>

This feature improves performance. Instead of executing queries independenty in different requests (so that we first execute an operation against the GraphQL server, then wait for its response, and then use that result to perform another operation), we can execute them together, thus avoiding the latency from the several requests.

Multiple Query Execution also allow us to better organize our GraphQL queries, splitting them into logical units that depend on each other, and that are conditionally executed based on the result from a previous operation.

## How to use multiple query execution

Let's suppose we want to search all posts which mention the name of the logged-in user. Normally, we would need two queries to accomplish this:

We first retrieve the user's `name`:

```graphql
query GetLoggedInUserName {
  me {
    name
  }
}
```

...and then, having executed the first query, we can pass the retrieved user's `name` as variable `$search` to perform the search in a second query:

```graphql
query GetPostsContainingString($search: String!) {
  posts(filter: { search: $search }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

**Multiple Query Execution** simplifies this process, allowing us to retrieve all data and execute all required logic in a single request:

```graphql
query GetLoggedInUserName {
  me {
    name @export(as: "search")
  }
}

query GetPostsContainingString @depends(on: "GetLoggedInUserName") {
  posts(filter: { search: $search }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

Multiple Query Execution is attained with the use of these special directives:

- **`@depends`** (operation directive): have an operation (whether a `query` or `mutation`) indicate what other operations must be executed before
- **`@export`** (field directive): export some field value from one operation, to inject it as an input to some field in another operation
{/* <!-- - `@deferredExport` (field directive): Similar to `@export` but to be used with **Multi-Field Directives**. In addition, directives `@include` and `@skip` are also made available as operation directives (they are normally only field directives), and these can be used to conditionally execute an operation if it satisfies some condition. --> */}

The GraphQL server will create the list of operations to load and execute, retrieving them from each `@depends(on: ...)`, and will export the values from any field containing `@export` as a dynamic variable (with name defined under argument `as`) to be input in any subsequent operation.

Combining these directives, we are able to split any complex functionality into intermediate steps, alternating `query` and `mutation` operations, add their dependencies in the required order, and execute them all in a single request by defining the outermost operation in `?operationName=...` (in the example above, that will be `?operationName=GetPostsContainingString`).

## Defining the operations to load and execute via `@depends`

When the GraphQL document contains multiple operations, we indicate to the server which one to execute via URL param `?operationName=...`; otherwise, the last operation will be executed.

Starting from this initial operation, the server will collect all operations to execute, which are defined by adding directive `depends(on: [...])`, and execute them in the corresponding order respecting the dependencies.

Directive arg `operations` receives an array of operation names (`[String]`), or we can also provide a single operation name (`String`).

In this query, we pass `?operationName=Four`, and the executed operations (whether `query` or `mutation`) will be `["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"]`:

```graphql
mutation One {
  # Do something ...
}

mutation Two {
  # Do something ...
}

query Three @depends(on: ["One", "Two"]) {
  # Do something ...
}

query Four @depends(on: "Three") {
  # Do something ...
}
```

## Sharing data across queries via `@export`

Directive `@export` exports the value of a field (or set of fields) into a dynamic variable, to be used as input in some field from another query.

For instance, in this query we export the logged-in user's name, and use this value to search for posts containing this string (please notice that variable `$loggedInUserName`, because it is dynamic, does not need be defined in operation `FindPosts`):

```graphql
query GetLoggedInUserName {
  me {
    name @export(as: $loggedInUserName)
  }
}

query FindPosts @depends(on: "GetLoggedInUserName") {
  posts(filter: { search: $loggedInUserName }) {
    id
  }
}
```

## Dynamic variable outputs

`@export` can produce 6 different outputs, based on a combination of:

- The value of the `type` argument (either `SINGLE`, `LIST` or `DICTIONARY`)
- If the directive is applied to a single field, or to multiple fields (via the **Multi-Field Directives** module)

The 6 possible outputs then are:

1. `SINGLE` type:
    1. Single field
    2. Multi-field
2. `LIST` type:
    1. Single field
    2. Multi-field
3. `DICTIONARY` type:
    1. Single field
    2. Multi-field

### `SINGLE` type / Single field

The output is a single value when passing param `type: SINGLE` (which is set as the default value).

In this query:

```graphql
query {
  post(by: { id: 1 }) {
    title @export(as: "postTitle", type: SINGLE)
  }
}
```

...the dynamic variable `$postTitle` will have value:

```json
"Hello world!"
```

Please notice that if `SINGLE` is applied over an array of entities, then the value for the last entity is the one that is exported.

In this query:

```graphql
query {
  posts(filter: { ids: [1, 5] }) {
    title @export(as: "postTitle", type: SINGLE)
  }
}
```

...the dynamic variable `$postTitle` will have the value for post with ID `5`:

```json
"Everything good?"
```

### `SINGLE` type / Multi-field

If `@export` is applied on several fields (by adding param `affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos` provided by the **Multi-Field Directives** module), then the value that is set on the dynamic variable is a dictionary of `{ key: field alias, value: field value }` (of type `JSONObject`).

This query:

```graphql
query {
  post(by: { id: 1 }) {
    title
    content
      @export(
        as: "postData",
        type: SINGLE,
        affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos: [1]
      )
  }
}
```

...exports dynamic variable `$postData` with value:

```json
{
  "title": "Hello world!",
  "content": "Lorem ipsum."
}
```

### `LIST` type / Single field

The dynamic variable will contain an array with the field value from all the queried entities (from the enclosing field), by passing param `type: LIST`.

When running this query (in which queried entities are posts with ID `1` and `5`):

```graphql
query {
  posts(filter: { ids: [1, 5] }) {
    title @export(as: "postTitles", type: LIST)
  }
}
```

...the dynamic variable `$postTitles` will have value:

```json
[
  "Hello world!",
  "Everything good?"
]
```

### `LIST` type / Multi-field

We obtain an array of dictionaries (of type `JSONObject`), each containing the values of the fields on which the directive is applied.

This query:

```graphql
query {
  posts(filter: { ids: [1, 5] }) {
    title
    content
      @export(
        as: "postsData",
        type: LIST,
        affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos: [1]
      )
  }
}
```

...exports dynamic variable `$postsData` with value:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Hello world!",
    "content": "Lorem ipsum."
  },
  {
    "title": "Everything good?",
    "content": "Quisque convallis libero in sapien pharetra tincidunt."
  }
]
```

### `DICTIONARY` type / Single field

The dynamic variable will contain a dictionary (of type `JSONObject`) with the ID from the queries entity as key, and the field values as value, by passing param `type: DICTIONARY`.

This query:

```graphql
query {
  posts(filter: { ids: [1, 5] }) {
    title @export(as: "postIDTitles", type: DICTIONARY)
  }
}
```

...exports dynamic variable `$postIDTitles` with value:

```json
{
  "1": "Hello world!",
  "5": "Everything good?"
}
```

### `DICTIONARY` type / Multi-field

In this combination, we export a dictionary of dictionaries: `{ key: entity ID, value: { key: field alias, value: field value } }` (using a type `JSONObject` that will contain entries of type `JSONObject`).

This query:

```graphql
query {
  posts(filter: { ids: [1, 5] }) {
    title
    content
      @export(
        as: "postsIDProperties",
        type: DICTIONARY,
        affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos: [1]
      )
  }
}
```

...exports dynamic variable `$postsIDProperties` with value:

```json
{
  "1":
  {
    "title": "Hello world!",
    "content": "Lorem ipsum."
  },
  "5":
  {
    "title": "Everything good?",
    "content": "Quisque convallis libero in sapien pharetra tincidunt."
  }
}
```

## Conditional execution of operations

When Multiple Query Execution is enabled, directives `@include` and `@skip` are also available as operation directives, and these can be use to conditionally execute an operation if it satisfies some condition.

For instance, in this query, operation `CheckIfPostExists` exports a dynamic variable `$postExists` and, only if its value is `true`, will mutation `ExecuteOnlyIfPostExists` be executed:

```graphql
query CheckIfPostExists($id: ID!) {
  # Initialize the dynamic variable to `false`
  postExists: _echo(value: false) @export(as: "postExists")

  post(by: { id: $id }) {
    # Found the Post => Set dynamic variable to `true`
    postExists: _echo(value: true) @export(as: "postExists")
  }
}

mutation ExecuteOnlyIfPostExists
  @depends(on: "CheckIfPostExists")
  @include(if: $postExists)
{
  # Do something...
}
```

## Exporting values when iterating an array or JSON object

`@export` respects the cardinality from any encompassing meta-directive.

In particular, whenever `@export` is nested below a meta-directive that iterates on array items or JSON object properties (i.e. `@underEachArrayItem` and `@underEachJSONObjectProperty`), then the exported value will be an array.

This query:

```graphql
{
  post(by: { id: 19 }) {
    coreContentAttributeBlocks: blockFlattenedDataItems(
      filterBy: { include: "core/heading" }
    )
      @underEachArrayItem
        @underJSONObjectProperty(
          by: { path: "attributes.content" },
        )
          @export(
            as: "contentAttributes",
          )
  }
}
```

...produces `$contentAttributes` with value:

```json
[
  "List Block",
  "Columns Block",
  "Columns inside Columns (nested inner blocks)",
  "Life is so rich",
  "Life is so dynamic"
]
```

In contrast, the same query that accesses a specific item in the array instead of iterating over all of them (by replacing `@underEachArrayItem` with `@underArrayItem(index: 0)`) will export a single value.

This query:

```graphql
{
  post(by: { id: 19 }) {
    coreContentAttributeBlocks: blockFlattenedDataItems(
      filterBy: { include: "core/heading" }
    )
      @underArrayItem(index: 0)
        @underJSONObjectProperty(
          by: { path: "attributes.content" },
        )
          @export(
            as: "contentAttributes",
          )
  }
}
```

...produces `$contentAttributes` with value:

```json
"List Block"
```

## Directive execution order

If there are other directives before `@export`, the exported value will reflect the modifications by those previous directives.

For instance, in this query, depending on `@export` taking place before or after `@strUpperCase`, the result will be different:

```graphql
query One {
  id
    # First export "root", only then will be converted to "ROOT"
    @export(as: "id")
    @strUpperCase

  again: id
    # First convert to "ROOT" and then export this value
    @strUpperCase
    @export(as: "again")
}

query Two @depends(on: "One") {
  mirrorID: _echo(value: $id)
  mirrorAgain: _echo(value: $again)
}
```

Producing:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "ROOT",
    "again": "ROOT",
    "mirrorID": "root",
    "mirrorAgain": "ROOT"
  }
}
```

## Multi-Field Directives

When the **Multi-Field Directives** feature is enabled and we export the value of multiple fields into a dictionary, use `@deferredExport` instead of `@export` to guarantee that all directives from every involved fields have been executed before exporting the field's value.

For instance, in this query, the first field has directive `@strUpperCase` applied to it, and the second has `@titleCase`. When executing `@deferredExport`, the exported value will have these directives applied:

```graphql
query One {
  id @strUpperCase # Will be exported as "ROOT"
  again: id @titleCase # Will be exported as "Root"
    @deferredExport(as: "props", affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos: [1])
}

query Two @depends(on: "One") {
  mirrorProps: _echo(value: $props)
}
```

Producing:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "ROOT",
    "again": "Root",
    "mirrorProps": {
      "id": "ROOT",
      "again": "Root"
    }
  }
}
```
