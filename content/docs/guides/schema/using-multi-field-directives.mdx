A multi-field directive is a directive that can be applied to multiple fields, instead of only one. When enabled, an argument `affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos` is added to all directives, where the relative positions of additional fields to apply the directive to can be specified.

For instance, in the following query, directive `@strTranslate` is applied only to field `content`:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    excerpt
    content @strTranslate
  }
}
```

Field `excerpt` can also be applied directive `@strTranslate`, by adding the directive argument `affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos` with value `[1]` (as `1` is the relative position of field `excerpt` from directive `@strTranslate`):

```graphql
{
  posts {
    excerpt
    content
      @strTranslate(
        affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos: [1]
      )
  }
}
```

The number of fields to add is not limited. In this query, the `dateStr` is also being translated:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    dateStr
    excerpt
    content
      @strTranslate(
        affectAdditionalFieldsUnderPos: [1, 2]
      )
  }
}
```

## Configuration

To enable or disable multi-field directives in the GraphQL schema, go to the "Multi-Field Directives" module on the Settings page, and tick/untick the checkbox for `Enable multi-field directives?`:

To enable or disable multi-field directives on a specific endpoint, select the desired option in block "Multi-Field Directives" from the corresponding Schema Configuration:
