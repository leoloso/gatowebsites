Have a directive modify the behavior of another directive.

This functionality allows to be able to use a directive, when otherwise we could not use it due to a type mismatch (i.e. when a directive cannot be applied on the field, because it has an input which is different than the field's output).

For instance, field `capabilities` returns `[String]` (an array of strings), and directive `@strUpperCase` receives `String`. Hence, executing the following query returns an error due to the type mismatch:

```graphql
query {
  user(by: {id: 1}) {
    capabilities @strUpperCase
  }
}
```

With composable directives, we can employ directive `@underEachArrayItem` (which iterates over an array of elements, and applies its nested directive on each of them) to set the stage before `@strUpperCase` is executed, making it receive a single element (of type `String`).

The query from above can be satisfied like this:

```graphql
query {
  user(by: {id: 1}) {
    capabilities
      @underEachArrayItem
        @strUpperCase
  }
}
```

## Meta directives

This module introduces two "meta directives":

1. `@underEachArrayItem` iterates over a list of elements from the queried entity, and passes a reference to the iterated element to the next directive.
2. `@advancePointersInArray` makes the next directive receive an element from under some path within the queried array/object.

Every meta directive can affect (or "nest") multiple directives at once. Which directives are affected is indicated via argument `affectDirectivesUnderPos`, which receives an array of positive integers, each of them defining the affected directive's relative position.

By default, argument `affectDirectivesUnderPos` has default value `[1]`, meaning that it will affect the directive right next to it.

In the example below, we have:

- `@underEachArrayItem` is the meta directive
- `@strTranslate` is nested under `@underEachArrayItem` (implicit default value `affectDirectivesUnderPos: [1]`)

```graphql
{
  someField
    @underEachArrayItem
      @strTranslate
}
```

In the example below, we instead have:

- `@strTranslate` and `@strUpperCase` are nested under `@underEachArrayItem` (as indicated by relative positions `[1, 2]` in argument `affectDirectivesUnderPos`)

```graphql
{
  someField
    @underEachArrayItem(affectDirectivesUnderPos: [1, 2])
      @strTranslate
      @strUpperCase
}
```

Meta directives can also be nested within meta directives.

In the example below, we have:

- `@underEachArrayItem` is the topmost composing directive
- `@strTranslate` and `@advancePointersInArray` are added under `@underEachArrayItem`
- `@strUpperCase` is added under `@advancePointersInArray`:

```graphql
{
  someField
    @underEachArrayItem(affectDirectivesUnderPos: [1, 2])
      @strTranslate
      @advancePointersInArray(path: 0) # Only 1st element in list
        @strUpperCase
}
```
