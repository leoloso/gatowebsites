Have a directive modify the behavior of another directive.

This functionality allows to be able to use a directive, when otherwise we could not use it due to a type mismatch (i.e. when a directive cannot be applied on the field, because it has an input which is different than the field's output).

For instance, field `capabilities` returns `[String]` (an array of strings), and directive `@strUpperCase` receives `String`. Hence, executing the following query returns an error due to the type mismatch:

```graphql
query {
  user(by: {id: 1}) {
    capabilities @strUpperCase
  }
}
```

With composable directives, we can employ directive `@underEachArrayItem` (which iterates over an array of elements, and applies its nested directive on each of them) to set the stage before `@strUpperCase` is executed, making it receive a single element (of type `String`).

The query from above can be satisfied like this:

```graphql
query {
  user(by: {id: 1}) {
    capabilities
      @underEachArrayItem
        @strUpperCase
  }
}
```

## Meta directives

Every meta directive can affect (or "nest") multiple directives at once. Which directives are affected is indicated via argument `affectDirectivesUnderPos`, which receives an array of positive integers, each of them defining the affected directive's relative position.

By default, argument `affectDirectivesUnderPos` has default value `[1]`, meaning that it will affect the directive right next to it.

In the example below, we have:

- `@underEachArrayItem` is the meta directive
- `@strTranslate` is nested under `@underEachArrayItem` (implicit default value `affectDirectivesUnderPos: [1]`)

```graphql
{
  someField
    @underEachArrayItem
      @strTranslate
}
```

In the example below, we instead have:

- `@strTranslate` and `@strUpperCase` are nested under `@underEachArrayItem` (as indicated by relative positions `[1, 2]` in argument `affectDirectivesUnderPos`)

```graphql
{
  someField
    @underEachArrayItem(affectDirectivesUnderPos: [1, 2])
      @strTranslate
      @strUpperCase
}
```

Meta directives can also be nested within meta directives.

In the example below, we have:

- `@underEachArrayItem` is the topmost meta directive
- `@underJSONObjectProperty` is nested under `@underEachArrayItem`
- `@strUpperCase` is nested under `@underJSONObjectProperty`

```graphql
query UppercaseEntriesInsideObject {
  entries: _echo(value: [
    {
      text: "Hello my friends"
    },
    {
      text: "How do you like this software so far?"
    }
  ])
   @underEachArrayItem
      @underJSONObjectProperty(by: { key: "text" })
        @strUpperCase
  }
```

## Configuration

To enable or disable composable directives in the GraphQL schema, go to the "Composable Directives" module on the Settings page, and tick/untick the checkbox for `Enable composable directives?`:

To enable or disable composable directives on a specific endpoint, select the desired option in block "Composable Directives" from the corresponding Schema Configuration:
