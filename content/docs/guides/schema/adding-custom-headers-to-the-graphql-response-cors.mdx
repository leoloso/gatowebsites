We can add custom headers to the GraphQL response. This is particularly useful to set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to avoid issues with CORS.

Response headers are set via the Schema Configuration, allowing us to send different headers for different endpoints. For instance, each endpoint can send the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with the specific domain it is intended to be used with, thus increasing the security of our APIs.

## Defining the Response Headers

The response headers can be configured in 2 places.

In the Schema Configuration applied to the endpoint under block "Response Headers", by selecting option `"Use custom configuration"` and then providing the desired headers (at one entry per line), with format `{header name}: {header value}`.

For instance, provide value:

```apacheconf
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://mysite.com
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: content-type,content-length,accept
```

Otherwise, the value defined in the Settings page for `Response Headers` is used:
