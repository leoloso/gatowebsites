This extension installs an internal GraphQL Server, that can be invoked within your application, using PHP code.

The internal GraphQL server provides class `GraphQLServer` with three methods:

- `executeQuery`: Execute a GraphQL query
- `executeQueryInFile`: Execute a GraphQL query contained in a (`.gql`) file
- `executePersistedQuery`: Execute a persisted GraphQL query (providing its ID as an int, or slug as a string)

For instance, we can hook into an action hook, and call `GraphQLServer::executeQuery` passing the hook values to the query:

```php
add_action(
  'new_to_publish',
  function (WP_Post $post) {
    if ($post->post_type !== 'post') {
      return;
    }
    $query = ' { ... } ';
    $variables = [
      'postTitle' => $post->post_title,
      'postContent' => $post->post_content,
    ]
    GraphQLServer::executeQuery($query, $variables);
  }
);
```
