Manipulate the values of fields within the GraphQL query, via a collection of utilities and special directives providing meta-programming capabilities.

## Field to Input

Obtain the value of a field, manipulate it, and input it into another field, all within the same query.

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    excerpt

    # Referencing previous field with name "excerpt"
    isEmptyExcerpt: _isEmpty(value: $__excerpt)

    # Referencing previous field with alias "isEmptyExcerpt"
    isNotEmptyExcerpt: _not(value: $__isEmptyExcerpt)
  }
}
```

## Field Value Iteration and Manipulation

## Field on Field

## Conditional Field Manipulation

## Field Default Value
