A GraphQL server normally exposes a single endpoint for retrieving and posting data, providing a unique behavior for all users and applications.

With custom endpoints, we can create and expose a custom GraphQL schema under its own URL, and grant access to this endpoint to a specific target:

- Some client or user
- A group of users with more access to features (such as PRO users)
- One of the several applications, like mobile app or website
- 3rd-party APIs
- Any other

Each custom endpoint can expose its own GraphQL schema, customized to some specific configuration, and is accessed via its own GraphiQL and Voyager clients.
