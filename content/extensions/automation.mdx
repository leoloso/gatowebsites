Automatically execute a GraphQL Persisted Query when some event happens on the site, via an "automator" user interface.

The automation trigger is any WordPress action hook, and the action is the execution of a GraphQL persisted query.

For instance, when creating a new post, automation rule **Add comments block to new post** checks if the `core/comments` block is present and, if not, it adds it at the bottom of the post:

  height="740"
  alt="Automatically inserting the comments block to new 'draft' posts"
  caption="Automatically inserting the comments block to new 'draft' posts"
/> */}

This extension also provides action hooks to be invoked from within <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/" target="_blank">WP-Cron</a>:

- `gatographql__execute_query`
- `gatographql__execute_persisted_query`

You can also add a hook in your application's PHP code, to react to the resolution of a GraphQL query, via the following action hooks:

1. `gatographql__executed_query:{$operationName}`
2. `gatographql__executed_query`
