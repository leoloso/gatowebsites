Collection of fields added to the GraphQL schema, providing useful functionality concerning URLs, date formatting, text manipulation, and others.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `_arrayGenerateAllCombinationsOfItems` | Combines the elements in the arrays, extracting one item from each array and merging it with all others, under the corresponding label |
| `_arrayOfJSONObjectsExtractProperty` | Given an array of JSON objects, with all of them having a common property, extracts the value of this property and replaces it as elements on the array |
| `_dataMatrixOutputAsCSV` | Outputs data as a CSV. It takes a matrix of data, and produces a CSV string. This string can then be uploaded to the Media Library, or uploaded to an S3 bucket or FileStack, or other |
| `_objectConvertToNameValueEntryList` | Retrieves the properties from a JSON object to create a list of JSON entries. It is used to transform a `JSONObject` output from some field, into a `[JSONObject]` that is input into another field |
| `_strConvertMarkdownToHTML` | Converts Markdown to HTML. It helps produce HTML content that is provided as input to some field or mutation, such as the `_sendEmail` mutation to send an email in HTML format |
| `_strDecodeXMLAsJSON` | Decodes an XML string as JSON. It helps process an XML string, such as an RSS feed, by converting it into a JSON object which can be manipulated by several fields in Gato GraphQL |
| `_strParseCSV` | Parses a CSV string into a list of JSON objects. It takes a CSV as input, and converts it into a format that can be extracted, iterated and manipulated using other function fields |
| `_urlAddParams` | Adds params to a URL |
| `_urlRemoveParams` | Removes params from a URL |
