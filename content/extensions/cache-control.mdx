Use HTTP caching to automatically send a `Cache-Control` header with a `max-age` value in the response of the GraphQL query, indicating for how long the response must be cached.

The Cache Control extension offers Cache Control Lists, where custom `max-age` values are defined for fields and directives.

Different queries containing different combinations of fields and directives will produce a different `max-age` value, with the response's `max-age` value is automatically calculated by the GraphQL engine.
