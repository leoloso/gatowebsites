Use HTTP caching to send a `Cache-Control` header with a `max-age` value in the response of the GraphQL query, indicating for how long the response must be cached.

The Cache Control extension offers Cache Control Lists, where custom `max-age` values are defined for fields and directives.

The response's `max-age` value is automatically calculated by the GraphQL engine, from the fields and directives present in the query.
