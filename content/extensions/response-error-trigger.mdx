This module adds global field `_fail` and directive `@fail` to the GraphQL schema, which add an entry to the `errors` property in the response.

```graphql
query {
  _fail(message: "Some error")
  
  posts {
    featuredImage @fail(
      message: "The post does not have a featured image"
    ) {
      id
      src
    }
  }
}
```
