Addition of the `@applyField` directive to the GraphQL schema, to execute a certain field on the resolved field's value.

The `@applyField` directive allows to execute another field, and either pass that resulting value along to another directive, or override the value of the field.

This allows us to manipulate the field's value in multiple ways, applying some functionality, and storing the new result in the response.

In the query below, the `Post.title` field for the object has value `"Hello world!"`. By adding `@applyField` to execute field `_strUpperCase`:

```graphql
{
  post(by: { id: 1 }) {
    title
      @passOnwards(as: "input")
      @applyField(
        name: "_strUpperCase"
        arguments: {
          text: $input
        },
        setResultInResponse: true
      )
  }
}
```

...the field value is transformed to upper case, producing:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "post": {
      "title": "HELLO WORLD!"
    }
  }
}
```
