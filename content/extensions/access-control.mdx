This extension allows us to create Access Control Lists, to manage who can access the different elements (operations, fields and directives) from the GraphQL schema, using the following rules:

- Disable access
- Grant access only if the user is logged-in or out
- Grant access only if the user has some role
- Grant access only if the user has some capability

We indicate what rules must be satisfied to access what schema elements, from among operations, fields, global fields, and directives.

When executing a GraphQL query, if it contains any of the selected schema elements in the Access Control List, the chosen rules are evaluated.

If any rule is not satisfied, access to that operation, field or directive is denied.
