In the Access Control editor, a new rule "Visitor IP" is made available:

![Access Control: Visitor IP rule](/assets/extensions/upstream-pro/acl-rule-visitor-ip.png "Access Control: Visitor IP rule")

We configure the rule with the list of IP addresses that can either access, or are denied access to, the schema elements.
