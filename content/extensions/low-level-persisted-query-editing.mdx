This extension makes all schema-type directives available in the GraphiQL editor when editing persisted queries, allowing you to avoid the user interface and add these directives already in the persisted query.

![Schema-type directives available in the Persisted queries editor](/assets/extensions/upstream-pro/low-level-persisted-query-editing.png "Schema-type directives available in the Persisted queries editor")

As an example, defining Access Control can be defined by adding the corresponding `@validate...` directive directly on the field:
