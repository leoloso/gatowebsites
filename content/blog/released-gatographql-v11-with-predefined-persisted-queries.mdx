## Predefined Persisted Queries

Version `1.1` adds predefined Persisted Queries to tackle a number of common admin tasks, including:

- Duplicate posts
- Replace strings in posts
- Replace and old domain with a new domain in posts
- Insert a block in posts
- Remove a block from posts
- Translate posts
- Import a post from another WordPress site
- Export a post into another WordPress site
- Many more

These Persisted Queries are all published as `private`, so they are not publicly exposed. These can be executed from within the wp-admin, by a logged-in user with the corresponding capability.

(An additional Persisted Query, to provide as webhook to InstaWP to process newsletter registrations, was added with status `draft`, so it's also not publicly exposed.)

Every Persisted Query contains the GraphQL query to execute for that task, documentation on what inputs must be provided, and a notice of which extensions are required (if any):

In addition, if the Persisted Query requires some specific configuration (such as "nested mutations"), a corresponding Schema Configuration is also created and defined accordingly.

You can execute the Persisted Query either:

- Straight from the GraphiQL client, passing the inputs as variables
- Invoking the Persisted Query's URL in the browser, passing the inputs as URL params

### How are predefined Persisted Queries useful?

The addition of predefined Persisted Queries makes it easier for admins to execute and automate tasks on their sites.

Do you need to translate a post into any language? Execute the Persisted Query "Translate post", passing the language and post ID as URL params.

Do you need to synchronize content across sites? Execute Persisted Query "Export a post into another WordPress site", passing the post slug to sync, and the destination site's endpoint URL, as params.

And so on. **It's like executing WP-CLI commands, but using GraphQL queries instead**, which are composed, stored and executed already within the wp-admin.

We plan to keep adding more predefined Persisted Queries in future releases.
