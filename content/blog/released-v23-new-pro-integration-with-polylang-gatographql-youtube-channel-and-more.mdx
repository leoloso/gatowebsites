Howdy! Here are all our news concerning **Gato GraphQL** up to mid-May 2024.

## Released Gato GraphQL v2.3

Gato GraphQL `v2.3` has been released with several improvements.

Among others, it adds mutations to create an update custom posts!

For instance, this query updates the title and content for a Custom Post Type `"my-portfolio"`:

```graphql
mutation UpdateCustomPost {
  updateCustomPost(input: {
    id: 1616
    customPostType: "my-portfolio"
    title: "Updated title"
    contentAs: { html: "Updated content" }
  }) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
    customPost {
      __typename
      ...on CustomPost {
        id
        title
        content
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## New PRO integration with Polylang!

Gato GraphQL PRO now has an integration with the [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) plugin.

With the new [Polylang extension](/extensions/polylang), you can use [Google Translate](/extensions/google-translate) to automatically translate a post to all languages defined in the Polylang settings, and store those translations in the corresponding posts.

It gets better! Thanks to [automation](/extensions/automation), newly-published posts can be automatically translated to all the languages, and even have their tags, categories, and featured image synchronized across languages.

Check out video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPbGVDLB9Lg" target="_blank">Automatically translating posts for Polylang</a> to experience how powerful this feature is:
