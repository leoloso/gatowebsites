Howdy! Here are all our news concerning **Gato GraphQL** up to mid-May 2024.

## New integration with Polylang!


## New integration with Polylang!

This same website, where you're reading this blog post, has been rebuilt anew:

To say that we are happy with it is an understatement (if you had visited the previous version, you'd know why ü§£).

This site is static, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I'm particularly excited about the new documentation sections, which make it easy to browse all the documents (and also copy the GraphQL queries):

/>

We've also added search to the site, powered by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). Click on the "search" icon on the top navigation, and find information in all documentation items and blog posts:

/>

Now that the website is (pretty much) completed, we will focus on creating more relevant content.

To this end, we've added a new [Comparisons](/comparisons) section, to demonstrate Gato GraphQL's capabilities as measured against other WordPress plugins. It contains 2 articles to date ([Gato GraphQL vs the WP REST API](/comparisons/gatographql-vs-wp-rest-api), and [Gato GraphQL vs WPGraphQL](/comparisons/gatographql-vs-wpgraphql)), and several more are on the way.

And after that, we'll start recording "How to" video tutorials, including demos "How to duplicate posts", "How to automatically translate posts", and "How to import posts from an RSS feed", among many others. Stay tuned!

Be welcome to browse this new site, and [give us feedback](/contact): Do you like it? Do you not like it? What could be improved?

## New Next.js WordPress starter for Gato GraphQL

Colby Fayock's [Next.js WordPress starter](https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-wordpress-starter) is a project to create headless WordPress sites powerd by Next.js and GraphQL.

As this project is based on WPGraphQL, I decided to fork it and adapt it, so it can also work with Gato GraphQL.

The result is [`GatoGraphQL/next-wordpress-starter`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/next-wordpress-starter), a **Next.js WordPress starter based on Gato GraphQL**.

Do check it out!

I additionally created [`leoloso/next-wordpress-starter`](https://github.com/leoloso/next-wordpress-starter), which allows us to use either WPGraphQL or Gato GraphQL (simply indicating which one to use by environment variable, with no other changes). I'm hopeful this project will be [merged into Colby Fayock's starter](https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-wordpress-starter/discussions/574)... that'd be really cool üòé

## Attending WordCamp Asia 2024

The Gato GraphQL team (that is me, Leo!) attended [WordCamp Asia 2024](https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/) in Taipei. If you were there and we met, it was a pleasure to meet you! (I appreciated talking to everyone.)

We'll next be attending [WordCamp Europe 2024](https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/) in Torino. Will you be there? If so, let's meet!
