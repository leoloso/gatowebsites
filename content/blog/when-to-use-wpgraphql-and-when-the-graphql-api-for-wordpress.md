A few days ago, I published an article on Smashing Magazine: [Making GraphQL Work In WordPress](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/making-graphql-work-in-wordpress/).

This article answers, from my own point of view (but objectively, I believe), the following questions:

❓ When should we use WPGraphQL, and when the GraphQL API for WordPress?<br/>
❓ Is there some advantage of one over the other, or some particular task that is easier to accomplish with one of them?

My conclusion (among a few others) is the following:

🤜🏽 When building a static site, use WPGraphQL<br/>
🤜🏽 When exposing a live GraphQL API, use GraphQL API for WordPress

The differences exposed in this article are from a bird-eye's view, broadly exposing a guide to decide when to use each plugin.

Sounds interesting? Please [check it out](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/making-graphql-work-in-wordpress/).

If you'd also like to understand the technical differences between the two plugins, some time ago I wrote another blog post: [🥊 GraphQL API vs WPGraphQL: the fight!](https://gatographql.com/blog/graphql-api-vs-wpgraphql-the-fight/).

Enjoy!
