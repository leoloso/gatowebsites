Gato GraphQL `v2.5` has been released, containing the following changes.

## Added persisted query to notify users on new post

Predefined persisted query [[PRO] Send email to users about post](/library/send-email-to-subscribers-notifying-of-a-new-post) has been added.

This query sends an email to all users, or to a segment of users, notifying of the creation of a new post on the site.

It is integrated with the new automation rule **Automatically sending an email to all subscribers notifying of a new post** added to Gato GraphQL PRO.

## [PRO] Added "WordPress hook mapping" for the Automation extension

There are WordPress hooks which cannot be directly used in the Automation Configurator, because they provide a PHP object via the hook, which can't be input as a GraphQL variable.

Starting from `v2.5` of Gato GraphQL PRO, several of these hooks have been mapped, by triggering a new hook prepended with `gatographql:` and the same hook name, and passing the corresponding object ID as a variable, which can be input as a GraphQL variable.

For instance, WordPress hook `draft_to_publish` passes the `$post` as variable (of type `WP_Post`). Gato GraphQL PRO maps this hook as [`gatographql:draft_to_publish`](/guides/manage/automating-tasks#wordpress-hook-mapping), and passes the `$postId` (of type `int`) as variable.

The following table lists down the mapped WordPress hooks:

| WordPress hook | Mapped hook by Gato GraphQL |
| --- | --- |
| [`{$old_status}_to_{$new_status}`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/old_status_to_new_status/) (passing `WP_Post $post`) | `gatographql:{$old_status}_to_{$new_status}` (passing `int $postId`) |
