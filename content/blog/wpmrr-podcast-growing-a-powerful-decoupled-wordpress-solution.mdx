Joe Howard, host from the WPMRR podcast, interviewed me (Leonardo Losoviz) for his show. We talked about many things, mostly concerning decoupled WordPress (and GraphQL in particular), and the ongoing challenges of the business of building a plugin.

I think it came out great. The questions were really good, and I made my best to provide honest responses, showing the picture as it is (or, at least, as I'm experiencing it while building Gato GraphQL). I'll encourage you to [check out the podcast](https://wpmrr.com/podcast/leonardo-losoviz-graphql-api/).
