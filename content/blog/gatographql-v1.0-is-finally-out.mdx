After a really long time (spanning several years), development of the Gato GraphQL plugin has finally reached `v1.0`!

Yaaaaaaaaaaay 🎉🍾🎊🥳🍻👏🥂🎈🙌

Alongside the release, we have also launched this current website, [gatographql.com](/).

The plugin has been renamed from the previous "GraphQL API for WordPress" (even tough this old name still appears in all previous blog posts), and it features a brand-new logo:

Starting from this version, the plugin will be released in the [WordPress plugins directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) (submission process currently ongoing), so you'll be able to install the plugin directly from your WordPress dashboard.

[Version 1.0 brings plenty of improvements](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/releases/tag/1.0.6), including the **integration with the (Gutenberg) block editor**, support for **private and password-protected endpoints**, and the **availability of (commercial) extensions** to extend the GraphQL schema and provide further functionality.
