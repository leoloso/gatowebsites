Below are the most important updates.

## Breaking changes

- Bumped minimum WordPress version to 6.1.

### Return no results when filtering data by an empty array

This GraphQL query filter posts by ID:

```graphql
query FilterPostsByIDs(
  $ids: [ID!]
) {
  posts(filter: { ids: $ids }) {
    title
  }
}
```

Previously, when passing an empty array in variable `$ids`:

```json
{
  "ids": []
}
```

...input `filter.ids` would be ignored, and the field would then return all results.

Now, passing an empty array means "retrieve no results".

To ignore the filter input, pass `null` instead.

The same behavior applies for all fields that accept the `filter.ids` input:

- `categories`
- `comments`
- `customPosts`
- `tags`
- `users`
- etc

## Improvements

- Added field `isGutenbergEditorEnabled`
- Support additional taxonomies for mutations on post tags/categories (not only `post_tag` and `category`)
- Added taxonomy field also to `PostTag` and `PostCategory` types
- Added `featuredImage` field on `GenericCustomPost`

### Added mutations to assign custom tags/categories to custom posts

You can now execute mutations to assign tags and categories on custom posts:

```graphql
mutation SetTagsAndCategoriesOnCustomPost(
  $customPostId: ID!
  $tagIDs: [ID!]!
  $categoryIDs: [ID!]!
  $append: Boolean
) {
  setTagsOnCustomPost(input: {
    id: $customPostId
    tagsBy: {
      ids: $tagIDs
    }
    taxonomy: "some-tag-taxonomy"
    append: $append
  }) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
    customPost {
      tags(taxonomy: "some-tag-taxonomy") {
        id
      }
      tagNames(taxonomy: "some-tag-taxonomy")
    }
  }

  setCategoriesOnCustomPost(input: {
    id: $customPostId
    categoriesBy: {
      ids: $categoryIDs
    }
    taxonomy: "some-category-taxonomy"
    append: $append
  }) {
    status
    errors {
      __typename
      ...on ErrorPayload {
        message
      }
    }
    customPost {
      categories(taxonomy: "some-category-taxonomy") {
        id
      }
      categoryNames(taxonomy: "some-category-taxonomy")
    }
  }
}
```

### Added Settings option to enable/disable logs

The complete GraphQL response for specific items (eg: when doing automation in PRO) can be logged under file `wp-content/gatographql/logs/info.log`.

A new option **Enable Logs?** in **Settings > Plugin Configuration > General** has been added, to enable printing these logs (it is `false` by default):

### Application password failed authentication: Show error in GraphQL response

If using Application passwords to authenticate the user against the GraphQL endpoint, and the authentication fails, the error message is now shown in the GraphQL response:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Application Password authentication error: The provided password is an invalid application password."
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "me": null
  }
}
```

### Added predefined persisted queries

Several persisted queries have been added:

- [PRO] Import post from WordPress RSS feed and rewrite its content with ChatGPT
- [PRO] Import new posts from WordPress RSS feed
- [PRO] Import HTML from URLs as new posts in WordPress

## Bug fixes

- On fields `blocks`, `blockDataItems`, and `blockFlattenedDataItems`, avoid error when post has no content
