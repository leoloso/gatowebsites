I have maintained that [GraphQL should not be in WordPress core](https://gatographql.com/blog/why-graphql-should-not-be-in-wordpress-core), because the WP REST API can already satisfy most of the developers' expectations, and adding GraphQL could become a security risk.

Well, good news is that, starting from WordPress 6.5, we can treat GraphQL as a "core" feature.

That is thanks to the introduction of [Plugin Dependencies](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/05/introducing-plugin-dependencies-in-wordpress-6-5/), which makes available the `Requires Plugins` plugin header, for any plugin to declare dependencies to other plugins:

```php
/**
 * Plugin Name: My Ecommerce Payments for Gato GraphQL
 * Requires Plugins: gatographql
 */
```

WordPress will then install the plugin alongside all its dependencies (as long as these are available in the [plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/)).

Since WPGraphQL and Gato GraphQL are in the plugin directory, we can now create a plugin that internally uses GraphQL, and distribute it via the plugin directory or, in general, without having to indicate how to install it.

For instance, we can now decide to use GraphQL to [fetch data to render the plugin's Gutenberg blocks](https://gatographql.com/guides/interact/working-with-gutenberg-blocks).
