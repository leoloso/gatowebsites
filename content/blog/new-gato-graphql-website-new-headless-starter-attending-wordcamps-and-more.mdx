Howdy! Here are all our news concerning Gato GraphQL up to March 2024.

## We got a new website!

This same website, where you're reading this blog post, is brand-new:

  height="940"
  alt="Gato GraphQL's new website"
  caption="Gato GraphQL's new website"
/>

To say that we are happy with it is an understatement (if you had visited the previous version, you'd know why ðŸ¤£).

This new website is a static one, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I'm particularly excited about the new documentation section, which makes it easy to browse all the documents:

  alt="Documentation in Gato GraphQL's new website"
  caption="Documentation in Gato GraphQL's new website"
/>

We've also added search to the site, powered by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). Click on the "search" icon on the top navigation, and find information in all documentation items and blog posts:

  alt="Search in Gato GraphQL's new website"
  caption="Search in Gato GraphQL's new website"
/>

Now that the website is (pretty much) completed, we will focus on creating more relevant content. We've added a new [Comparisons](/comparisons) section to demonstrate Gato GraphQL capabilities as measured against other WordPress plugins. It contains 2 articles so far ([against the WP REST API](/comparisons/gatographql-vs-wp-rest-api), and [against WPGraphQL](/comparisons/gatographql-vs-wpgraphql)), and more comparisons are on the way.

And coming soon, we'll start recording "how to" video tutorials ("How to duplicate posts", "How to automatically translate posts", "How to import posts from an RSS feed", etc). Stay tuned!

Be welcome to browse the new site, and [give us feedback](/contact). Do you like it? Do you not like it? Did you find anything confusing? Please let us know.
