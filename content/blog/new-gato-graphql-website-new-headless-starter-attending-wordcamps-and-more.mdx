Howdy! Here are all our news concerning Gato GraphQL up to March 2024.

## We got a new website!

This same website, where you're reading this blog post, is brand-new:

  caption="Gato GraphQL's new website"
/>

To say that we are happy with it is an understatement (if you had visited the previous version, you'd know why ðŸ¤£).

This new website is a static one, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I'm particularly excited about the new documentation section, which makes it easy to browse all the documents:

Be welcome to browse the new site, and [give us feedback](/contact).
