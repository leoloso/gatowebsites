The just-released `v6.0` of Gato GraphQL greatly simplifies the plugin, streamlining its architecture and shipping way less stuff.

Previously, Gato GraphQL was meant to be a Swiss-Army Knife, to be used for all data-related tasks in the WordPress site. Its objective was not just to fetch data, but to also manage the WordPress site via GraphQL.

But this proposition has proved difficult to get buy-in from the community, as anybody looking for a plugin to solve a certain problem would search for a tool to specifically resolve that problem, and not for a tool that could resolve that problem among 150 others, while having a higher cost and greater complexity to implement.

## The Gato GraphQL plugin gets streamlined

From now on, <Link href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gatographql/" target="_blank">Gato GraphQL‚Üó</Link> will simply be a GraphQL server, providing what is expected: The GraphQL single endpoint to fetch and mutate data.

This new version introduces these important changes:

- The single endpoint is enabled by default
- Custom endpoints and persisted queries have been removed

Upon installation, the plugin's menu (on the left) now presents fewer items:

## The PRO offerings get streamlined

Gato GraphQL PRO previously included plenty of modules to augment the functionality and expand the GraphQL schema, all of them shipped via a single bundle.

However, people needing only access control to provide security for their public APIs may not be encouraged to get a bundle with everything, as that means having to pay a bigger price than just what they need.

That's why, from now on, the PRO offerings have been thoroughly streamlined and decoupled from each other. You can now purchase and install only the extension(s) that you need.

There are now [10 extensions](/extensions) available, which can be installed on their own.

You can browse the extensions also from within the plugin:

## The pricing get streamlined

With these changes, you can save money. If you need only access control for your public APIs, you can purchase the [Access Control extension](/extensions/access-control) (at u$d 24.99 for 5 sites) and nothing else.

Better yet, the [pricing](/pricing) for the extensions has also gone down, as each license expands the number of domains where you can install the extension. For instance, the personal tier increased from 1 to 5 domains, and the agency tier from 50 to 500 domains.

In addition, you can purchase the license as a Long Term Deal, so you pay once and receive support and product updates forever.
