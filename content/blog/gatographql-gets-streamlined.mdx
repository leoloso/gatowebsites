**Important:** After updating the plugin (i.e. not installing anew), you need to deactivate and then re-activate the plugin, otherwise the "GraphiQL" and "Schema" items won't appear on the menu.

This version greatly simplifies the plugin, streamlining its architecture, and shipping way less stuff.

Previously, Gato GraphQL was meant to be a Swiss-Army Knife, to be used for all data-related tasks in the WordPress site. Its objective was not just to fetch data, but also to manage the WordPress site via GraphQL.

But this proposition proved difficult to get across, as anybody with a problem would search for a tool to specifically resolve that problem, and not for a tool that could resolve that problem among 150 others, but at a bigger price and bigger complexity.

From now on, Gato GraphQL will be a GraphQL server

Some changes are:

- The single endpoint is enabled by default
- The single endpoint's clients (GraphiQL and Voyager) are disabled default
- Custom endpoints and persisted queries have been removed
