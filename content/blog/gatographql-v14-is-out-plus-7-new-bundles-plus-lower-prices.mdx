## 7 new bundles

Gato GraphQL can be augmented via [extensions](/extensions), which are offered in [bundles](/bundles) satisfying common use cases (providing a better value for money over purchasing the extensions individually).

We received feedback that, for several simple use cases, the bundles contained too many extensions, making them more expensive than they could be.

For instance, to [replace the old domain with a new domain in all posts](/library/replace-the-old-domain-with-a-new-domain-in-all-posts), we had to get the “Application Glue & Automator” Bundle, which was priced at u$d 119 for 1 domain.

Hence, we decided to create several new bundles, which are tailored to ever-more specific use cases:

| New bundle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [“Automated Content Translation & Sync for WordPress Multisite” Bundle](/bundles/automated-content-translation-and-sync-for-wordpress-multisite) | Automatically create a translation of a newly-published post using the Google Translate API, for every language site on a WordPress multisite.|
| [“Better WordPress Webhooks” Bundle](/bundles/better-wordpress-webhooks) | Easily create webhooks to process incoming data from any source or service using advanced tools, directly within the wp-admin.|
| [“Easy WordPress Bulk Transform & Update” Bundle](/bundles/easy-wordpress-bulk-transform-and-update) | Transform hundreds of posts with a single operation (replacing strings, adding blocks, adding a thumbnail, and more), and store them again on the DB.|
| [“Private GraphQL Server for WordPress” Bundle](/bundles/private-graphql-server-for-wordpress) | Use GraphQL to power your application (blocks, themes and plugins), internally fetching data without exposing a public endpoint.|
| [“Selective Content Import, Export & Sync for WordPress” Bundle](/bundles/selective-content-import-export-and-sync-for-wordpress) | Import hundreds of records into your WordPress site from another site or service (such as Google Sheets), and selectively export entries to another site.|
| [“Unhindered WordPress Email Notifications” Bundle](/bundles/unhindered-wordpress-email-notifications) | Send personalized emails to all your users, and notifications to the admin, without constraints on what data can be added to the email.|
| [“Versatile WordPress Request API” Bundle](/bundles/versatile-wordpress-request-api) | Interact with any external API and cloud service, posting and fetching data to/from them.|

Now, to replace the old domain with a new domain in all posts, we can get the “Easy WordPress Bulk Transform & Update” Bundle, which is priced at u$d 59 for 1 domain.

To keep the naming for all bundles consistent, we also renamed all already-existing bundles:

- [“All in One Toolbox for WordPress” Bundle](/bundles/all-in-one-toolbox-for-wordpress) (from “All Extensions” Bundle)
- [“Responsible WordPress Public API” Bundle](/bundles/responsible-wordpress-public-api) (from “Public API” Bundle)
- [“Simplest WordPress Content Translation” Bundle](/bundles/simplest-wordpress-content-translation) (from “Content Translation” Bundle)
- [“Tailored WordPress Automator” Bundle](/bundles/tailored-wordpress-automator) (from “Application Glue & Automator” Bundle)

## Reduced the price for all existing bundles

In addition to creating more-specific bundles, we have also reduced the prices for all existing bundles!

For instance, the [“All in One Toolbox for WordPress” Bundle](/bundles/all-in-one-toolbox-for-wordpress) is now priced at u$d 129 for 1 domain (it was u$d 149).

[Check the new pricing for all bundles](/pricing).

## Install extensions and bundles in more domains

Finally, the licenses for the “Professional” and “Agency” tiers now permit [installing your purchased bundles and extensions on more domains](/pricing):

- “Professional”: 10 domains (it was 5)
- “Agency”: 50 domains (it was 25)
