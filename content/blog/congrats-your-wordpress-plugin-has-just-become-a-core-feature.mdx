Because the WP REST API already ships in WordPress core, I have generally advised to simply use the REST API to feed data to our WordPress plugins and Gutenberg blocks.

Not anymore. [WordPress 6.5 was released today](...), including an incredible new feature: **Plugin Dependencies**.

With [Plugin Dependencies](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/05/introducing-plugin-dependencies-in-wordpress-6-5/), any WordPress plugin that is available in the [plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) can be defined as a dependency for our plugin, and WordPress will install that dependency right before installing our plugin.

As a consequence, every plugin in the directory essentially becomes a "core" feature, as it will be implicitly installed whenever required by any other plugin.

Some applications are both obvious and not really needed, such as having an WooCommerce add-on declare a dependency on WooCommerce, as the website owner will most certainly already use WooCommerce.

But when the required plugin provides "tooling" for some other plugin, so that we can't expect the website owner to have that plugin installed in advance (or even know of its existence), the result can be really impactful.

That is exactly the case with Gato GraphQL.

## GraphQL becomes a "core" feature in WordPress

The direct consequence of Plugin Dependencies is that, from now on, plugins can rely on GraphQL, and WordPress developers can, for first time ever, consider GraphQL as an alternative to the REST API.

All they have to do is to **Gato GraphQL** as a plugin dependency:

```php
/**
 * Plugin Name: Set of blocks for your portfolio 
 * Requires Plugins: gatographql
 */
```

Having the GraphQL server available, they can point to a private GraphQL endpoint and [fetch data to render their plugin's Gutenberg blocks](https://gatographql.com/guides/interact/working-with-gutenberg-blocks), and avoid creating (and maintaining) REST controllers.



More importantly for us at Gato GraphQL, you can 


I had always maintained that [GraphQL should not be in WordPress core](https://gatographql.com/blog/why-graphql-should-not-be-in-wordpress-core), because the WP REST API can already satisfy most of the developers' expectations, and adding GraphQL could become a security risk.

Well, good news is that, starting from WordPress 6.5, we can treat GraphQL as a "core" feature.

That is thanks to the introduction of [Plugin Dependencies](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/05/introducing-plugin-dependencies-in-wordpress-6-5/), which makes available the `Requires Plugins` plugin header, for any plugin to declare dependencies to other plugins:

```php
/**
 * Plugin Name: My Ecommerce Payments for Gato GraphQL
 * Requires Plugins: gatographql
 */
```

WordPress will then install the plugin alongside all its dependencies (as long as these are available in the [plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/)).

Since WPGraphQL and Gato GraphQL are in the plugin directory, we can now create a plugin that internally uses GraphQL, and distribute it via the plugin directory or, in general, without having to indicate how to install it.

For instance, we can now decide to use GraphQL to [fetch data to render the plugin's Gutenberg blocks](https://gatographql.com/guides/interact/working-with-gutenberg-blocks).
