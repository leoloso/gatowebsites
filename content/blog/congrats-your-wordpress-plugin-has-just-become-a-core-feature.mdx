Because the WP REST API already ships in WordPress core, I have generally advised to simply use the REST API to feed data to our WordPress plugins and Gutenberg blocks.

Not anymore. [WordPress 6.5 was released today](...), including an incredible new feature: **Plugin Dependencies**.

With [Plugin Dependencies](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/05/introducing-plugin-dependencies-in-wordpress-6-5/), any WordPress plugin that is available in the [plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) can be defined as a dependency for our plugin, and WordPress will install that dependency right before installing our plugin.

As a consequence, every plugin in the directory essentially becomes a "core" feature, as it will be implicitly installed whenever required by any other plugin.

Some applications are both obvious and not really needed, such as having an WooCommerce add-on declare a dependency on WooCommerce, as the website owner will most certainly already use WooCommerce.

But when the required plugin provides "tooling" for some other plugin, so that we can't expect the website owner to have that plugin installed in advance (or even know of its existence), the result can be really impactful.

That is exactly the case with Gato GraphQL.

## GraphQL becomes a "core" feature in WordPress

GraphQL is an interface to fetch, modify and store again any piece of data from the WordPress site. Any plugin that needs to interact with data (and pretty much all of them do) can potentially use GraphQL to satisfy its needs.

GraphQL is "tooling". And Gato GraphQL is the tooling provider.

By having your plugin declare a dependency on Gato GraphQL, the GraphQL server will be immediately available for your own use.

As plugins can safely rely on GraphQL, WordPress developers can (for first time ever) truly consider GraphQL as an alternative to the REST API.

For instance, by having the GraphQL server available, developers can point to a private GraphQL endpoint and [fetch data to render their plugin's Gutenberg blocks](/guides/interact/working-with-gutenberg-blocks), and avoid creating (and maintaining) REST controllers.

## Could the plugin dependency become a risk to the website?

When added as a dependency, a **Gato GraphQL** item will appear in the wp-admin's menu, and the website owner might rightfully wonder: "Where did that come from?"

That is something that could be annoying to the website owner, and it can be improved (for instance, by releasing a **Gato GraphQL Lite** plugin, which simply installs a GraphQL server for internal consumption only, not visible through the UI).

A more important question is: Would the new site become less secure, as it now offers a public GraphQL endpoint that any visitor can access? Could it unintentionally expose private data?

The response is no. [Gato GraphQL by default does not enable the public single endpoint](/guides/config/enabling-and-configuring-the-single-endpoint), so it can be installed without fear of security risks.

## Adding Gato GraphQL as a plugin dependency

To be able to use GraphQL in your plugin, you'll need to declare `[gatographql](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gatographql/)` as a plugin dependency in the plugin header:

```php
/**
 * Plugin Name: Blocks for cooking recipes
 * Requires Plugins: gatographql
 */
```

Then you can point to the [internal `blockEditor` endpoint](/guides/code/feeding-data-to-blocks-in-the-editor):

```
https://mysite.com/wp-admin/edit.php?page=gatographql&action=execute_query&endpoint_group=blockEditor
```

To have more control and configure the GraphQL schema to your liking (for instance, to enable [nested mutations](/guides/schema/using-nested-mutations)), you can also [create an internal endpoint that is exclusive to your plugin](/guides/config/creating-custom-internal-endpoints-for-blocks).

Enjoy!
