Because the WP REST API already ships in WordPress core, I have generally advised to simply use the REST API to feed data to our WordPress plugins and Gutenberg blocks.

Not anymore. [WordPress 6.5 was released today](...), including an incredible new feature: **Plugin Dependencies**.

With [Plugin Dependencies](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/05/introducing-plugin-dependencies-in-wordpress-6-5/), any WordPress plugin that is available in the [plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) can be defined as a dependency for our plugin, and WordPress will install that dependency right before installing our plugin.

As a consequence, every plugin in the directory essentially becomes a "core" feature, as it will be implicitly installed whenever required by any other plugin.

Some applications are both obvious and not really needed, such as having an WooCommerce add-on declare a dependency on WooCommerce, as the website owner will most certainly already use WooCommerce.

But when the required plugin provides "tooling" for some other plugin, so that we can't expect the website owner to have that plugin installed in advance (or even know of its existence), the result can be really impactful.

That is exactly the case with Gato GraphQL.

## GraphQL becomes a "core" feature in WordPress

The direct consequence of Plugin Dependencies is that, from now on, plugins can rely on GraphQL, and WordPress developers can, for first time ever, consider GraphQL as an alternative to the REST API.

All they have to do is to **Gato GraphQL** as a plugin dependency:

```php
/**
 * Plugin Name: Set of blocks for your portfolio 
 * Requires Plugins: gatographql
 */
```

Having the GraphQL server available, they can point to a private GraphQL endpoint and [fetch data to render their plugin's Gutenberg blocks](/guides/interact/working-with-gutenberg-blocks), and avoid creating (and maintaining) REST controllers.

It is true that a new **Gato GraphQL** item will become suddenly visible in the wp-admin's menu, and the website owner might rightfully wonder: "Where did that come from?"

However, because [Gato GraphQL by default does not enable the public single endpoint](/guides/config/enabling-and-configuring-the-single-endpoint), it can be installed without any security concern at all.

## Using GraphQL in your plugin

To be able to use GraphQL in your plugin, you'll need to declare `gatographql` as a plugin dependency (using the plugin header as shown above), and then you can point to the [internal `blockEditor` endpoint](/guides/code/feeding-data-to-blocks-in-the-editor):

```
https://mysite.com/wp-admin/edit.php?page=gatographql&action=execute_query&endpoint_group=blockEditor
```

To have more control and configure the GraphQL schema to your liking (for instance, to enable [nested mutations](/guides/schema/using-nested-mutations)), you can also [create an internal endpoint that is exclusive to your plugin](/guides/config/creating-custom-internal-endpoints-for-blocks).

Enjoy!
